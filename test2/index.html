<h2 id="on-hierarchy">On Hierarchy</h2>

<p>I’m working to better understand the context in which R. grew up, because I find it fascinating that Colon Classification – a pure faceted system – arose from someone near the top of a traditionally hierarchical social milleiu. One might expect someone coming from this background to design a system reinforcing rather than dissipating the hierarchical structure of knowledge.</p>

<p>Trautmann (2011) provides some helpful clarification for Westerners: What we typically call <em>caste</em> is more properly <em>varna</em>. The Vedic tradition (the classical system of Hindu knowledge and philosophy) divides people into four <em>varnas</em>, which specify an individual’s <em>dharma</em>. The <em>Rig Veda</em> (c. 1500-1000 bce) includes a creation story in which “the primordial being, Purusha (man or spirit), often also called Prajapti, lord of creatures, or Brahma” completes a complex act of self-sacrifice, in which</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…parts of his dismembered body became the things of the phenomenal universe (animals, plants, the division of time, and so forth) including human society in its four parts: From his mouth can the brahmin, who is associated with the sacred utterance of the Veda; from his arms, the kshatriya or warrior; from his thighs, the vaishya farmer and tradesman; and from his feet the shudra or servant. (96)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parallel to this esoteric system, we have the boots-on-the-ground system of <em>jatis</em> which are more akin to clans in the Western context: Extended family groups typically located in a specific region and associated with a particular occupation. Also similar to the western tradition, complex social norms formed over time governing inter-jati marriages and economic relations. And finally, we have the <em>castes</em> proper, which “number in the thousands and they are generally limited in their extent to a single region of India.” Caste provided yet another layer of social and economic norms, which often entrapped lower-caste individuals in disadvantageous circumstances. Caste discrimination was officially outlawed with “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dalit">the constitutions adopted by India in 1949 and by Pakistan in 1953</a>”, but caste remains a relevant social grouping. Legal repairative frameworks (similar to Affirmative Action) exist for what are legally termed “scheduled castes;” And in India’s democracy, castes often function as political interest groups whose influence politicians must be cognizant of.</p>

<p>But this is only the internal layer of the heirarchy: There is also the British Raj (1858-1947) to contend with.<sup>1</sup> R. was born in 1892, in present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkazhi">Sirkazhi / Siyali</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanjavur,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@10.0078203,77.8920773,7.04z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3baab89cea453039:0xe113da9b1f632be6!8m2!3d10.7869994!4d79.1378274!16zL20vMDFfemtt?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu</a>, then located in the Raj’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency">Madras Presidency</a>. Butterworth (1932) notes, “The storm of the mutiny raised only a couple of ripples in Madras. …The transfer of the government of India to the crown caused no stir whatever. The local annals are silent on the subject becuse methods and principles remained unchaged.” (267) However, Madras was hit particularly hard by the 1876-7 famine, including about a third of the fallowed land and some four million deaths. (Prior to the famine, Madras was experiencing an annual populat growth of about 1.2 million; Its population growth remained halted until 1881.)</p>

  <li>The East India Company’s control of India lasted from the late 1700s until the rebellion of 1858, after which the EIC was disolved and India was govered directly by Queen Victoria (titled “Empress of India” by Parliament in 1876). Both modern-day Pakistan and Myanmar (then Burma) were included in British India.</li>

<p>“…Katarzyna Niewiadoma, looking resplendent in yellow…”</p>

<p>SFPL used to have a page where they talked about not complying with some material in the Patriot Act which involved FBI requests for patron records. This was way back in the early 2000s and it’s not there any more.</p>

<p>Serious Person / Unserious Persion is a false dichotomy: A perons’s seriousness is temporal, relational, contextual, interperitive, etc. etc. This is doubly true when considering art and artists; <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/Sprechstimme">Sprechstimme’s</a></em> significant and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dNLAhL46xM">continuing</a> <a href="https://jenniferwalshe.bandcamp.com/album/all-the-many-peopls">impact</a> in classical vocal music is a perfect example of this enormous grey area.</p>

<p>I know it’s a psychoactive drug, but I simply cannot imagine extending my sobriety to caffine.</p>
