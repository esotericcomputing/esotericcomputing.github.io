## A Librarian Looks Back: An autobiography of Dr. S.R. Ranganathan, Appended with an evaluation of his life and work by P.N. Kaula

This book is exceedingly difficult to track down,<sup>1</sup> which is a shame because it includes a wealth of detail and helpful chronologies absent from most biographies. The only accessibly copy in North California is at UC Berkeley -- Luckily, UCB provides [free reference cards](https://framework.lib.berkeley.edu/forms/reference-card/new) for visiting researchers, and the campus is only a half-hour bike ride straight up Telegraph from my home in Oakland. The Doe Library's Gardner stacks begin on the ground level, and _descends_ four levels; With its brutalist architecture and hald-cranked compact shelving, the space feels like a PS1-era survival horror game.



### Background, Structure, and Style

R. wrote the autobiographical portion of this book in the late 1960s (TK find exact date), and it was published as an article in (TK). The text was updated by R.'s "disciple" and working associate P.N. Kaula, and was published alongside a cohort of several other works celebrating R.'s 1992 centenary.

In classic R. fashion, the book is idiosyncratic in both structure and style. It's split into three parts (A, B, and C) with lettered chapters and numbered subsections (e.g., AG3, BE8, etc.) Parts A and B are R.'s original text: Part A covers his career as librarian of Madras U. from his application through his leave; Part B covers his work with the Madras Library Association \[MALA\]. Part C was added by Kaula, and is a mix of narrative and appendicies. It covers R.'s work after leaving Madras U, provides more specifics on his legislative contributions, includes several helpful chronologies, and includes sketches of R.'s personal life -- which is notably absent from the autobiography. Kaula's command of English is less asured than R.'s: His writing contains semi-frequent gramatical irregularities.

Stylistically, R. gives us a bildungsroman built from annecdotes; These are often framed around interpersonal interactions and typically result in an important learning or realization. It's written in the third person; nearly all names are initialisms (without a key); and dialog is formatted as follows:

	BSR - How is it you have come to the Marina today? You seldom come
	PRA - (With a smile)--I would not have come without a purpose.
	BSR - Tell us then your purpose.
	PRA - (Turning to SSR)--Congradualtions! You have been selected.
	SRR - What! Have they already decided? Who told you? Is it PR?



### Navigating Politics

I'll have more to say about this in the later section on neurodivergent behavior, but the most noticable feature of R.'s annecdotes is that they're often concerned with his challenges navigating interpersonal spaces threaded with complex political interests and beauracracy. He doesn't always see the angles his peers and superiors are playing, and comes to rely on trusted friends and advisors to inform him when potential storms are on the horizon.

At the book's opening, he tells us almost nothing about his work as a math professor, instead painting himself as a doe-eyed naif suddenly tossed into the pallace intruige of higher ed admin. During the Mardras U. librarianship screening process, his prickly attitude becomes an unexpected assett: His refusal to kiss the screeners' rings unexpectedly makes a favorable contrast with his sycophantic competetors. At this stage, he describes himself as "an untamed youth who formed wrong impressions for wrong reasons and continued to harbor them." As his profile grows with the success of his library reforms, he often relies on his command of facts-and-figures (what we'd now call "data-driven decision-making") to overcome the caltrops his admin detractors increasingly toss in his path.

Chapters AS, AT, and AU (Socio-political background, Premonitions, and Direct action) are a essentially a catalog of slights, beaurecratic machinactions, and outright lies utilized against him during his Madras U. tenure. "It may be asked why one should lay bare the unseamy \[sic\] side or the adversity of one's life. The reason is that otherwise others would fall into the illusion that SRR was a favoured child of God or circumstances. This would make them fatalistic and deprive them of self-reliance and initiative."

The first of these is an historical overview of the broader socio-political currents in India, beginning with the "latest cycle of cultural exhaustion of the Indian community \[beginning\] about the thirteenth century," via the South-moving occupation of India by "Muslim invaders from West Asia." He frames the establishment and eventual "decadence" of the Moghuls as paving the way for India's gradual East India Company takeover beginning in the mid-1700s.<note>ethnonationalism</note>

	As a modern reader, I found myself slightly uncomfortable with what seemed like an ethnonationalist reading of long history; i.e., where -- or when, rather -- do we draw the line for when an "invading army" becomes a naturalized demographic? To paraphrase from Levi's _A Primer for Forgetting_, to become French, the separate peoples of France must first forget their differences.




But this context is neccesary for R.'s discussion of the "divide-and-conquer" political schemes enacted by the British to keep their heterogenus colonial subjects from achieving solidarity: e.g., favoring different ethnic groups with government appointments and legal advantages. The exact structure and efficacy of these schemes differed in India's regions according to their demographics. This later post-facto analysis clarifies some of R.'s spicier attitudes concerning English-educated Indians in the Five Laws:

	The British Government had been recruiting its servants in the lower civil service largely from the minority community \[ed: Mulslims\]. This happened partly because most people in the upper strata of the majoriry commnity \[ed: Hindus\] preferred to continue in agriculture, commerce, trade, arts and crafts, and other diverse hereditary professions and vocations, as it paid them well. Only a few among them took to English education and entered government service. It is these few that were used as a hammer to break the solidarity of people of South India.

He opens this 3-chapter section with this background, because it informs some of the administrative conflicts he later faces; The University's executives are mostly politicians, some of whom oppose R.'s requests and proposals for purely partison reasons. (Side note: R. assumes the reader will have the lay-of-the-land here, so he doesn't describe the administrative structure of Madras U. in detail -- This information would have been helpful for less-familiar readers like myself.)

#### Sidebar: Anti-Indian prejudice
Along the way, we also get an unvarnished report of a few racist incidents with Europeans, often fueled by disengenous press. In the chapter AK: Amusing Incidents Arboad, he describes an extrachange with a library worker was initially affraid to greet him, having read a recent news report about a violent "riot" in the Madras.<sup>Mutiny</sup> R. tells the worker a freind of his receives the Madras daily paper (_the Hindu_) shipped from overseas, and he'll return when the correct issue arrives to compare the reporting. Aparently the "riot" was a group of antsy school kids on a field trip, who tossed some pebbles at a streetlamp while awaiting a delayed train.




### Experience in England

R. reveals some interesting details about his education in England. He was initially supposed to train at the library school at the British Museum; but the clerk who receives him tells him the program has closed, and to instead go to University College London's \[UCL\] new program, which opened 2 years prior. At UCL, his advisors allow him to skip classes he doesn't need (e.g. Sanskrit and German, which he speaks fluently and reads passably, repsectively) -- a practice I wish SJSU would embrace lol. He takes classes through November; Apprentaces at Croydon Public Library through December; Then, visits other libraries to observe their functioning.

His critiques of some of the classes later inform his own approach to LIS pedagogy. He's particularly frustrated when context is elided, E.g., when a reading room's dimensions are presented without any reasoning for why they were selected. In these critiques, we see R. begin to identify many of the information gaps the _Five Laws_ was designed to fill:

	The course included also library legilsation. Here again, it was all a string of facts regarding the way in which the section of the Library Act were interpreted in practice by the different Library Authorities. Nothing was said about the sociological or educational background of the National Library System. Nothing was said about the way in which library rate \[ed. tax allocation\] was determined from time to time. \[...\] 

	The rules in the \[Anglo-American Catalogue Code\] were never studied systematically. The normative principles behind the rules were not touched upon. In fact, the idea that the rules should have been based on some fundamental principles never dawned in anybody's mind.

These educational gaps are reenforced during his observation tour, where he's "amazed that there was hardly any library which had not mangled \[DDC\]. Nor could SSR find in his discussion with the various classifiers any normative principles guiding such a mangling."

On this tour, he finds a library landscape shifting through "different stages of development" in many of its technical aspects, such as reference service and charging systems. This exposure allows for an analysis of different methods which appear in _The Five Laws_. He arrives firmly on the side of open, versus closed, access after seeing both strategies in use and learning some "lurid facts:" about the loss of books: "The library in Westminster served highly educated, highly placed, clean-collared officers, and one at East London servicing the general public introduced open access about a year earlier. The loss in the former was ten times that in the later."






### The Return Trip

R.'s three-week return trip on the MV Dumana created an unintended space for deep reflection. Aside from the "scholarly" Captain, who befriended R. after observing his daily pre-sunrise recitations of _The Ramayana_ on deck, R.'s fellow passengers were "all Britishers employed in India in plantations, railways, and other industries owned by the British. There was hardly any intellectual among them. They spent most of their time in gossip and frolic."

Comparing this period to a less-intensive version of "the prolonged silence phase passed through by aspirants of self-realization," it "enabled SSR to come to a firm decision about his future." He lays out the "Benefits of Silence" in an ordered list. I've seen this referred to obliquely in other texts, but am reproducing it in full below, because of its import to the context of _The Five Laws_.

Because this text is (from what I can tell) absent from the internet, I will reproduce it in full here:

--- 

### AL5: Analysis of the Benefits of Silence

#### 51 Benefit 1: Work-Chastity
The industry, devotion to work, and the patriotism of the British people living on the British soil had made a tremendous impact on the outlook of SSR. These formed the lasting and beneficial elements is \[sic\] the result of his informal education in Great Britiain. They induced in him much of emulation. In its turn, this induced in him a resolve to pratise work-chastity for the rest of his life. This was Benefit 1 of his visit to Great Briain.

#### 52 Benefit 2: Urge For Library Work
The penetration of library service into the different areas in Great Britain and almost into every home had impressed SSR tremendously. This convinced him that there was sufficient work to do in India in the library sphere. This induced in him an urge to think out a plan for a similar library provision in India. This was Benefit 2.

#### 53 Benefit 3: Realisation Of The Potency Of Library Service
The positive correlation between the provision and acceptance of universal library service on the one hand and the well-informed conduct of the poorer classes, of the urge to creative work among the intellectuals, and a spirit of self-reliance and the fullness of life in all the sections of the people was unmistakable to SSR. This induced in SSR the feeling that the people of India should be helped in a similar way by a nation-wide library system. This was Benefit 3.

#### 54 Benefit 4: Realisation Of The Opportunity For Social Service
Further, SRR realised the greater opportunity for nation-building, for the cultivation of the human resources, for social service, which work in a library could give than in any other walk of life. This made SRR long for the formation of a vigorous, dedicated, and enlightened library profession in India, adequite in quality and sufficient in number. This was Benefit 4.

#### 55 Benefit 5: Appreciation Of Opportunity In Library Service
Again, SRR appreciated the opportunity which work in a library would give, to know and to work with a large section of peopel as against the handful of students with whom alone teaching of mathematics in the higher university classes would involve. This appreciation made him prefer library work to teaching work at the university level. This was Benefit 5.

#### 56 Benefit 6: Realisation of Opportunity for Research
Further, SRR also realised that there were as many problems offered by library science as those offered by mathematics to give an exhilarating and arresting challenge to intellect and intuition. This realisation made him accept the change over from mathematics to library science without regret of any kind. This was Benefit 6.

#### Benefit 7: Determination To Stay In The Library Profession
All these ideas born out of experience during the nine months of stay in Great Britain made SRR give up his old longing to go back to the teaching work in college and to make a willing decision once and for all to stay on in the library profession and seek therein his own emotional, intellectual, and spiritual fulfilment in the full measure of his capacity. This decision made SRR utilise his three weeks of life on the high seas for education himself in solitude by deep and incessant meditation to equip himself as much as possible by ruminating on what he had seen and absorbed, and by planning about the way in which, he should serve his own country and the world at large through library service and work in library science. This was Benefit 7.

---

Yogeshwar (see "Prismatic Philosopher" below) provides this good distiliation:
- To practise patriotism through devotion to work
- To exploit the potential of libraries to educate citizens
- To popularise and organise a nation-wide library system in India
- To realise library service as mass education instead of the restricted education potential in a college class.

I found "Benefit 3" particularly interesting because it reads in some ways like the effusive cultural flattening common to undergrads who spend a semester abroad or adults who go on midlife _Eat, Pray, Love_ sojourns. (That sentence came out snarky, but I _truly_ mean this in a value-neutral way. I lived in Singapore for a year, and am [as guilty of this](https://medium.com/@devinsmithwork/the-bells-at-lau-pa-sat-30f5c471995e?sk=09ad11f84a3500edcaebedacbdc38706) as the next person.) R.'s description of indefatigable British industriousness reads like an inverted version of a traveling Westerner's description of suffusive Indian spirituality: That is, it's a gross oversimplification still retaining a broad nugget of cross-cultural information; Deeply impactful for the subjective observer, even if it lacks nuance.

In R.'s case, this vaugely monolithic view of the British citizenry segues into next Benefit; It seems unclear if R. is aware the "nation-building" British libraries helped to bring about sometimes involved messy, conflicting, and self-interested views of the character and direction of the nation. (See "[Context Part 2 : England](./2024-09-28)" e.g. Peatling, 2004; Hewitt, 2000; Fletcher, 1996) Nonetheless, this simplified view translates into a powerful conceptual trajectory for empowering a colonized people: Coupled with some sly implications in _The Five Laws_ regarding the relationship between Russian public libraries prior to the October Revolution, we can see R.'s line of thinking here.




### Legislative Work

Here's an interesting tidbit I've seen repeated nowhere else: While in England, R. attends a conference concerning rural library service, where he befriends a Col. Mitchell. This connection enables him to "to get copies of the publications of the \[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust\]... These were of immense value to SRR on his return to Madras--in drafting the Public Library Bill, and in working out the memorandom for the development of the Library Systems, for Madras, and the other states." 

This book contains a good overview of R.'s legislative work, and provides some context for the many draft bills he produced. As early as 1929, R. is interfacing with Madras U. executives who have a seat at the table regarding potential legislative changes enabling more gov't funding for library, and suggesting (based on his experience) adjustments to bills.

Much of this legislative work occured in the context of the Madras Library Association, \[MALA\] founded in 1928. Occasionally you'll see this described as (paraphrasing) "The Association Ranganathan founded;" but this is not really accurate. R. was involved in the formation of the group, but he gives most of the credit to Ayyanaki Venkataramaniah (himself not directly involved in library or, according to R., much of a reader at all), and K. V. Krishnaswamy Ayyer, who convened the first promotional meeting, enrolled many members directly, and was elected president at the first official meeting. Note the following breakdown of MALA's initial membership by professional field:

	Library 		  2
	Journalism 		  6
	Engineering 	  2
	Medicine	 	  6
	Education		 46
	Administration 	 22
	Business		 32
	Law 			294
	Total 			410

"The conncetion, of 82% of the members enrolled belonging to the legal and educational profession, with K V Krishnaswammy Ayyar being a leader of the Bar and a member of the Executive of the University of Madras, is unmistakable." MALA's initial leadership likewise hailed from a broad swath, including a retired police commissioner; A museum superintendent; A "well-known patriot"; And someone from the Postal Audit Office. But far from being a rag-tag crew, MALA's broad cross-section allowed for and wide-reaching promotional activities.

At MALA's first meeting to establish a constitution, three main goals were set:
1. Request funds from the Corporation of Madrass to be provisioned to public libraries;
2. Appeal to local boards in urban areas to establish libraries; and
3. Appeal to the public in rural areas to form library associations.

In the context of _The Five Laws_, the role of draft legislation is crucial to the second goal, while the more entertaining parts of the book can assist with the third. Based on his familiarity with the Carnegie Trust legislation mentioned above, R. writes his first draft bill in 1930, while attending the All-Asian Educational Conference, where he works as the secretary of the Library Services Section. MALA "gave wide publicity to the draft Act by printing it as Annexure 7 to its Annual Report for 1930."

This first draft bill opened the door for future collaboration; R. was asked to write or sit on committes to write 32 draft bills from 1930 to 1967. However, getting these bills passed was another matter. From 1931 to 1939, MALA "made three attempts to have a Public Libraries Act put on the statute book." These were unsucesfull "In spite of the Association having succeeded in getting most of the local bodies to Pass resolutions asking for library legislation."

However, in the early 1940s, a fortuitous connection occured when a former student of R.'s, Avinashilingam Chettiar, had become a minister of Education. In his typical oddball, single-minded fashion, R. shows up at the ministers office, and presses him to do something with the draft bill. Chettiar "piloted the Bill through the Select Committee stage...\[and it\] was passed through legislature in 1948", thus becoming India's first Public Library Act.



### Outreach and educational work with MALA; Royalty donation

R.'s outreach work with MALA was extensive: Between 1931 and 1939, he spoke at 147 publicity events and published 68 articles for the organization. The first appearance of the Five Laws occured during a seris of lectures at Chidambaram, in December 1928, during the Annual South Indian Educational Conference. While technically part of a Madras University genearl-interest lecture series ("vacation lectures"), the timing and selection of R. as speaker was arranged by Ayyer and K. A. Neelakanta Sastry, both members of the University Executive and admin in MALA. "They also got the permission of the University to invite local bodies to attend the lectures. \[...\] At that time, SRR arranged also an exhibition of library pictures and library apparatuss. The audience was more than 500 strong. Thus a good impact was made on the educated public about the value of library service."

R.'s oft-repeated honorific "The Father of Library Science in India" is actually not overblown: He directed India's  first graduate Library Science program, under the auspices of MALA in 1929. This was a summer program and its first cohort was 12 students: 7 graduates and 5 "non-graduates but with some years of experience working in libraries." The _Five Laws_ were presented in brief during this program. The management of this program was transferred to Madras University the next year, with R. directing in his capacity as University Librarian.

This permiable membrane between R.'s public university and private association roles gave some ammunition to his political opponents in the University admin, who essentially accused him of double-dipping in partisan newspapers. Once again, a friendly member of the exec arrives and councils him through the appropriate responses to acusatory inquiries.

But Ranganathan's contributions to MALA were also monetary: He donated the authorship rights of _The Five Laws_, along with several other key texts including _Colon Classification_, to MALA. That is, his royalties went to the association, and took only a handful of gratis copies. Kaula reports that during its first six months, _The Five Laws_ had generated nearly Rs 1,000, and suggests a large part of the eventual Rs 20,000 the Association had set aside for the construction of its headquarters was likely from these royalties.<note>conversions</note>

Conversions: I couldn't find any online inflation calculators that went this far back for rupees (which, it should be noted, were still administered by the British at this point). The closest comparison I could find was Rs 1,000 in 1957 is around $1,214 in USD

























## S.R. Ranganathan: Pragmatic philosopher of information science: A Personal biography by Yogeshwar Ranganathan, 2001

We have a hard drive failure to thank for the 2001 biography written by R.'s son Yogeshwar \[Y.\], _S.R. Ranganathan: Pragmatic philosopher of information science:  Personal biography_. Initially begun in the cohort of material during R.'s 1992 centenial, this crash erased the working files, leaving Y. with only a paper copy of the rough draft. After reading the other biographies produced during 1992, he noted the absence of material of R.'s personal life, and shifted his book's focus when he returned to writing five years later. "Whatever little that was presented about R's private life was 'second or third hand' information, not always near the truth." (20) -- He is concerned with correcting the record, as it were.

Even so, Y. struggled with disentangling personal elements from someone who's life and work are so intrinsically linked: "Can one write a personal biography of Mahatma Gandhi without slipping into _Ahimsaa_ \[ed. nonviolence\] and _Sataagraha_ \[ed. roughly, civil disobedience\] and the Freedom Movement in India?" Often, Y. is coneptually working backward, tracing the roots of R.'s Library Science to familial, cultural, and his "beyond-biology genealogy" in math, law, and education.




### R.'s family history

This book fills significant gaps relating to R.'s family history, upbringing, and role within the extended family structure.

"Around 1800," there were two brothers living in Kottapada ("a small village in the Cauvery delta, near Karaikal and about 8km east of Ubhayavedantapuram"). They teamed up to "conduct business" with the British, with one staying in Mardas. They used the money to buy "productive land holdings around the home base." over time, "the clan must have increased in size to a point when the holdings were decentrilised and the original economic strategy got dissipated." The holdings were eventually split between two brothers, Purushottaman Nilakantan and Ramamritan Ranganathan, R.'s father.

Ramamritram "lived off the income from the agricultural land." "\[He\] must have been quite erudite in the classics and used to hold discourses on the Ramayana. He was highly literate in Sanskrit and Tamil, as well as Grantham, a bridge-language between the two. He is reported to have been something like the wise man of the hamlet."

R. was the eldest son and had two siblings, brother Natesan and sister Aviam, who "was born a few months after" Ramamritam's death in 1898, "probably of cholera." (R. was six years old.) After, the family was looked after by R.'s mother Sitalakshi and her two brothers Subbayyar and Kalyana Mama. R.'s mother "Sitalakshi spent most of her life with us \[e.g. in R.'s immediate household\]" until her death in 1953.

R.'s marraiage to Rukmani was arranged in 1907, when he was 15 and she 11 -- a practice not unusual for the time and place. The "arrangments" had been "made by 'elders' after elaborate and careful check-outs by matching horoscopes and so on." Y. indicates they lived for many years "married in contract only," before establishing a "conjugal" relationship some time in the "late 1910s."


#### Side Note: Y's countefactual
R.'s marraige with Rukmani produced no children; She died in a drowning accident in 1928. "Apart from the letters they had exchanged, I know very little about her." This is jumping ahead a little, but Yogeshwar provides an interesting counterfactual here. By 1928, R. had progressed from a math professor to a well-known champion for the Library Movement, complete with the better salary of an administrator. He was already managing the affairs of an extended household (see below), but did his lack of children play a part in his obsessive quest for the library movement?

	He purportedly took \[the accidental death of Rukmani in 1928\] as a clearance to give up all ambitions to found a family of his own, leaving him full free reign to "draw joy and delight for himself by serving the country and the society". Was this the "natural" thing for a man of 36 to do at the prime of his manhood? Did he have apprehensions that he might have been the cause for the absence of children?

R. was "pushed to re-marry, which he did in late 1929." His second wife Srada was "the daughter of... an affluent personality in Coimbatore, dedicated to technological inventions." Yogeshwar was their only child, a typical "spolit brat." 

"During the time that the Parents lived in Triplicane, our home at Sami Pillai Street was a base of a kind of 'joint family' with father as its _Karta_ or managing agent." (93) Members of the extended family sometimes moved for work, and R.'s house remained a consistent place to "park" the younger generation while parents managed relocations. There was also a "lean and lovable \[...\] paternal uncle Jagannathan" who apparently wrote (pseudonamously, as "_Saagaran_") a fictionalized account of the family home's goings-on in the Tamil weekly _Ananda Vikatan_ during the 1930s.



























## A Personal Aside: Neurodivergent behaviors in Kaula's "Personal Glimpses" of Ranganathan

As the old bromide goes: When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Upon being formally diagnosed with ASD 1 last year, the blissfully academia-free summer I envisioned instead became a crash course on Autism, as I trawled through the literature to gain a better understand of my particular location within a wildly heterogenus diagnosis and get up-to-speed on the current research. (To be a little more specific, under the DSM4 I would have been diagnosed with Asperger's: I had no developmental delays, my deficiencies are primarily in interpersonal communication and sensory processing, and my masking is decent and has improved with time.) My healthcare provided a handful of sessions with a therapist specializing in the transitionary period after diagnosis; When I told her I was a librarian, she laughed and said "Oh, I see a lot of you people." Perhaps it's intuitive that individuals with excessively "systemetizing" congnition would be drawn to the knowledge organization field. (Frith, 2008)

TK cut this -- Historians often caution against interpreting long-distant events through an overly modern lense; The past, as another old bromide goes, is a foreign country. Frith (2003) focuses her historical reporting to cases where we have objective clinical reports somewhat in-line with modern scientific methods (e.g., "The wild boy of Aveyron" and Kaspar Hauser), but also includes several much-older cases of individuals whose reported behavior includes many autistic features (e.g., Brother Juniper, and Hildegard von Bingen).

This table-setting is important, because without this recent deep dive, I probably wouldn't have realized that many of P.N. Kaula's annecdoates about R. in the chapter "CK: Personal Glimpses" are describing textbook ASD behaviors -- Like, _literally textbook_, i.e. Atwood (2015). Some of this may be authorial overexageration -- Kaula is clearly besotted with R.'s unconventional intensity -- but I personally feel it's worth relating some of this, just to put it out there. As Yogeshwar comments, "The total personality of a person is a composite entity made up of many facets. Its shape and color will be different each time depending on who does the assessment and presentation." (76)

- **Rigid habbits**: Ranganathan lobbied for the library to be open 365 days a year, and personally worked there every day of the week. He famously worked a shift on the day of his marriage. He typically ate one meal between 9 and 9:30 in the morning, and drank no caffine or alchohol. He read a section of _The Ramayana_ each morning; When he finished, he'd start over, marking the date on a front page.

- **Circumscribed interests**: Per Kaula, "From the early hours of his rising till late at night, he would talk of nothing but library science. Even in ordinary conversation he would connect every topic to library science and once he started talking or writing about it, he forgot himself." Yogeshar comments, "That R. was totally infected by his Library Science was a fact of life that his biological family had come to accept."

- **"Islands of ability"**: Yogeshewar relates an annecdote where R. buys a wrist watch, but it seems to stop working every few days. His son tries it out, no problems. He takes it to the repairman, who says there's nothing wrong. When Y. asks R. to wind the watch, as it turns out, he had been winding it in the wrong direction for a full minute every day, because he concluded that the direction which made the knob more difficult to turn must be incorrect.

- **Difficulty with ambiguous social environments**: From the outset (i.e., the interview process), R. describes himself as broadly lost in the complex beauracratic and political milleiu of University admin. It's worth noting he's 32 years old, and a reasonably well-respected mathematician at this point. He is fortunate to have friends who guide him through difficult situations. With time, he adjusts to the odious reality of the admin milleiu, "For, as he grew in age, SRR has been seeing every now and then at the levels of political life --local, dsitrict, state, national and international level--such inconsistencies. This seems to be an inexorable weakness in man." (118) This graudal adaptation in social deficit areas is characteristic of ASD individuals with lower support needs (née "high-functioning").

- "R. had little talent to face up to political pressures. \[...\] Whenever he was confronted by a critical situation, he tried to find solace by concentrating on his work." (Yogeshewar, 66)

- More descriptions of his problematic social interactions are described in CK75-CK77 (Unattached to Family, Hard Task Master, and The Measuring Rod). The general picture painted is of a man obsessed with his work, neglecting his wife, pushing his coworkers to extremes without regard for their feelings, and cutting people off when they refuse to or cannot meet his exacting standards.

- Later in life, R. has a health crisis, which neccesitates Y. traveling to the hospital Bangalore. The staff there had commented R. had been in-and-out of lucidity, and "had been incoherent in his speech, talking of some numbers and digits which no one was able to decipher." What the staff didn't know was that "R. had allotted a classification number to each member of the family. Father was '2w1'. We were familiar with these because every letter he wrote carried them."

- **Black-and-white thinking**: R. relays a few annecdotes where he interprets official requests in unusually extreme ways. For example, an admin requests that official architectural proceedings for the new library come only from the architecht; In response, R. stops vising the construction site altogether, expecting that this request will shortly arrive. (It does not.) According to Kaula, "SRR did not care of the middle course. He could not adjust or compromise." He describes a conversation with a government official who comments "SRR cannot fit in the government machinery. He wants the things to be done immediately and he cannot adjust himself to circumstances."

- **Inheritability**: Children with ASD are more likely to have parents in "highly systemetizing" or "technical occupations" like academia, healthcare, engineering, and financial analysis. (Dickerson, et al. 2014) Ranganathan's father regularly gave exegesic talks on the _Ramayana_.

- **Physical clumsiness**: "All those who have known Ranganathan must have noticed his total lack of manual dexterity. He always had a water-tight theory of how something should be done, but could rarely actually do it himself." (Yogesheway, p 58)






## Leaves / Pressings

This week, [former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-nfl-punter-chris-kluwe-arrested-anti-trump-protest-city-council-rcna192978) in response to the Huntington Beach City Council's plan to add a plaque to the local library refrencing MAGA.  Kluwe studdied history and political science in college, making him well-suited to identify historical precedents for the rapid [state capture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-capture) currently occuring in the US. Kluwe's speech at the council meeting was breif and forthright; But in later interviews, he repeats a largely-held perspective that I also used to hold, and from which this research project has fully disabused me: 

> We want to honor the library. We want there to be a plaque, but we don't want MAGA on it because _the library isn't supposed to be political_. \[emphesis mine\]

This naive understanding of libraries' political neutrality is, in part, pushed by libraries themselves: That is, a key philosophical pillar of librarianship is that patrons should have access to material espousing a wide range of political views, even from the extreme or potentially dangerous fringes (e.g. [_Death to the Fascist Insect_](https://spurleditions.com/sla) or [_Industrial Society and its Future_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm)).

This perspective is linked with our support for free inquiry; That is, Librarians provide this material in good-faith because we resist juding _why_ patrons are interested in it. For example, a patron may be researching violence in order to promote pacifism. Tangentially, one fascinating if less-remembered episode concerns [provisions in the PATROIT Act](https://www.library.illinois.edu/ala/2024/10/07/15-years-of-fear-ala-patriot-act/) allowing law enforcement to access patron records which were previously protected by privacy laws, and sometimes [barring librarains from discussing these interactions](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/librarians-speak-out-first-time-after-being-gagged-patriot-act). Librarians were put in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to break the law or violate their professional ethics.

...But _all of this is a red herring_. None of this is what I mean when I say the idea "libraries have never been political" is naive. This statement is comprable to saying "capitalism is an economic system, not a political system," conveniently ignoring the _creation and mainteance of legislation_ enabling and regulating corporations and other essential vehicles of capitalist activity. From a legislative perspective, public libraries are enabled by collectivist wealth redistribution: They are built and maintained by public money generated from taxation and other public revenue sources -- which could just as easily be spent elsewhere or not collected at all. Public libraries continue to exist because we (the polity) use our democratic system to elect representatives who maintain legal instruments enabling free access to media as a public good.

Every time someone says "I love the library!" they are, essentially, saying "I love that our government redistributes wealth to so I can access information for free!" And we should never forget that!! I love the library!!! And I would love to see similar library-like legal instruments for (e.g.) healthcare, housing, and childcare, too!!!!
















Speaking personally (e.g. not as a representative of my current workplace or graduate program), I'm strongly opposed to -- if honestly a little impressed by! -- the [organized monkeywrenching tactics being employed by right-wing groups](https://uniteagainstbookbans.org/2023-book-bans/) to exploit loopholes in public libraries' good-faith book withdrawl policies to censor opinions they don't agree with.

1. - A digitized version is held by Hati Trust and is inaccessible without a certain kind of account (SJSU does not provide these).
- It is likewise unavailable on Black OA channels.
- During the period of my research, no copies have surfaced on the secondary market.
- The only physical copy in Northern California is housed at UC Berekeley; There is an additional copy at UC's  Southern Regional Library Facility in LA.



### Mutiny:
My cursory research on the 1853 mutiny indicates there's been quite a bit of scholarship on the portrayal of Indians in British periodicals from this period -- much of it wildly belittling and fabricated. This is, however, slightly outside of my scope here.
