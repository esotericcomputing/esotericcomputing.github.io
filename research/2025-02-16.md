<h4>Sidebar: British anti-Indian Prejudice</h4>

<p>
	Along the way, we also get an unvarnished report of a few racist incidents with Europeans, often fueled by a disengenous European press. In the chapter "AK: Amusing Incidents Arboad," he describes an extrachange with a library worker was initially affraid to greet him, having read a recent news report about a violent "riot" in the Madras.<sup>4</sup> R. tells the worker a freind of his receives the Madras daily paper (<i>the Hindu</i>) shipped from overseas, and he'll return when the correct issue arrives to compare the reporting. Aparently the "riot" was a group of antsy school kids on a field trip, who accidentally broke a streetlamp while tossing pebbles to alleviate boredom while awaiting a delayed train.

## Leaves / Pressings

### CYA

It seems pertient to mention the following material expresses my opinions as a private citizen, rather than in my public-sector role with CDL, or my role as an SJSU student -- though of course, many current events concerning the Dept. of Education have a direct impact on my role as a student.


### "Dear Collegue"

Welcome to the winter of our discontent lol

Two weeks ago, The UC created a ["federal updates" page](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/federal-updates) to track the fast-and-furious onslaught of education-related executive orders & other such matters having a material impact on the UC. For example, the UC is the single largest recipient of NIH research grants, which swiftly cycled through a complete freeze and a partial lift, while the rank-and-file employees handling the grants are currently sinking in a [morass of chaos & fear](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/nih-grant-freeze-biomedical-research/681853/). 



### Concerning "The library isn't supposed to be political"

This week, former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe [was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-nfl-punter-chris-kluwe-arrested-anti-trump-protest-city-council-rcna192978) in response to the Huntington Beach City Council's plan to add a plaque to the local library refrencing MAGA.  Kluwe studdied history and political science in college, making him well-suited to identify historical precedents for the rapid [state capture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-capture) currently occuring in the US. Kluwe's speech at the council meeting was breif and forthright; But in later interviews, he repeats a largely-held perspective that I also used to hold, and from which this research project has fully disabused me: 

> We want to honor the library. We want there to be a plaque, but we don't want MAGA on it because _the library isn't supposed to be political_. \[emphesis mine\]

This naive understanding of libraries' political neutrality is, in part, pushed by libraries themselves: That is, a key philosophical pillar of librarianship is that patrons should have access to material espousing a wide range of political views, even from the extreme or potentially dangerous fringes (e.g. [_Death to the Fascist Insect_](https://spurleditions.com/sla) or [_Industrial Society and its Future_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm)).

This perspective is linked with our support for free inquiry; That is, Librarians provide this material in good-faith because we resist juding _why_ patrons are interested in it. For example, a patron may be researching violence in order to promote pacifism. Tangentially, one fascinating if less-remembered episode concerns [provisions in the PATROIT Act](https://www.library.illinois.edu/ala/2024/10/07/15-years-of-fear-ala-patriot-act/) allowing law enforcement to access patron records which were previously protected by privacy laws, and sometimes [barring librarains from discussing these interactions](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/librarians-speak-out-first-time-after-being-gagged-patriot-act). Librarians were put in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to break the law or violate their professional ethics.

...But _all of this is a red herring_. None of this is what I mean when I say the idea "libraries have never been political" is naive. This statement is comprable to saying "capitalism is an economic system, not a political system," conveniently ignoring the _creation and mainteance of legislation_ enabling and regulating corporations and other essential vehicles of capitalist activity. From a legislative perspective, public libraries are enabled by collectivist wealth redistribution: They are built and maintained by public money generated from taxation and other public revenue sources -- which could just as easily be spent elsewhere or not collected at all. Public libraries continue to exist because we (the polity) use our democratic system to elect representatives who maintain legal instruments enabling free access to media as a public good.

Every time someone says "I love the library!" they are, essentially, saying "I love that our government redistributes wealth to so I can access information for free!" And we should never forget that!! Speaking personally, I love the library!!! And I would love to see similar library-like legal instruments for (e.g.) healthcare, housing, and childcare, too!!!!

4. My cursory research on the 1853 war there's been quite a bit of scholarship on the portrayal of Indians in British periodicals from this period -- much of it wildly belittling and fabricated. This is a bit outside the scope of what I'm doing, but thought I should mention it's a rich research area.
