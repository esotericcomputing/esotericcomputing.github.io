# Working - Context Part 2 : England, 1924


## Science

British intellectual life underwent radical changes in the 19th c.


### Secularism

Picking up on the work of Karl von Hoff, Charles Lyell's 1830 _Principles of Geology_ argued the Earth must be much older than the biblically-stipulated 6,000 years. _Principles_ made a significant impact on Charles Darwin, who understood the ramifications of this timescale in biology; The two scientists became close friends and correspondents. Following Darwin's return from his 1831 Galapagos expedition, Lyell continually pestered him to publish his theories, as Darwin languished in depression and imposter syndrome for the next two decades. His 1858  Linean Society presentation with Russell Wallace, and 1859 publication of _On the Origin of Species_ swung wide the door Lyell had cracked open, precipetating a full reconsideration of the roles of religion and science in British culture as a whole. (Heffer, 2022)

The emergence of religious skepticism into the public sphere (like the 1860 Huxley-Wilburforce debate in Oxford), "can be seen with highindsight as the end of the medival world, whose ideas were so often rooted in blind faith, and the start of the modern, whose ideas were so often rooted in rationalism." (Heffer, 2022, p. 200) But just as it does today, a wide range existed between the poles of religion and secularity; And eventually we found ourselves, according to Himmelfarb, with the poles paradoxically reversed: "The final irony is to have the old stereotypes, of an enlightened science and a bigoted religion, replaced by new ones: A 'scientific naturalism' that was dogmatic, narrow-minuted jealous of its newly-aquired authority, lacking social vision and emotional depth; and a 'spiritualism' that was imaginative, open-minded, compassionate, receptive to new forms of consciousness and speculation." (Heffer, 2022, p. 227)


















As mentioned in the last session, TK TK PUBLIC EDUCATION IN INDIA FIRST











Fueled by the 1840 Penny Post, decreasing printing costs leading to swells of new publications, and the abolution of stamp duty for Newspapers, literacy was already on the rise. The midcentury saw a flurry of new libraries open, including ____ TK TK free libraries. 


"Eventhough Radical activity 

With many reforms arrising broadly from the Select Commitee on Drunkenness (1834) (fletcher, 1996) <note>As someone who found both sobriety and library science at roughly the same time, can confirm!</note>

"By mid century there was an increasing acceptance of the need to provide cultural facilities in order to combat the ignorance of the urban workers..." (Fletcher)

### Science

During the 19th c., the practice and institutionalization of science underwent serious shifts; The term "scientist" itself was coined by William Hewell in 1834, in a complaint that fields were becoming too specialized.

But these clarifications were often pursued in line with political ideology

But the act of investigating these uncharted 




And particularly in the beginning of the 19th c., the membrane between science and esoterica was still permeable. But the selection of which theories to pursue came with its own considerations: "animal magnetism was one of several sciences of life that became political game pieces in the ideological battle between different medical constituencies. The best known example is the field of comparative anatomy in which rival developmental theories were champion at UCL and king's." (Winter, YYYY, p. 47)




So many new scientific frontiers were being broached, but the 

But the selection of which of these uncharted territories to explore was often itself guided by politics, with pet theories becoming "political game pieces in the ideological battle between different medical constituencies."

Peatling (2004) mentions the "fear of political decline" in the interwar years.






### Propaganda by the Deed


### Anarchism

Anarchism: From Peatling's (2004) perspective, national identity is a zero-sum game; These habbits, presentations, and concepts "occupy space which might have been filled by altnerative formations" creating "images of 'community' and of 'us' and 'them', \[thus affecting\] individual and collective thought and action in a way which must be regarded as political." (p. 36) But _must it_? Could it not be regarded as artistic? Spritual? Esoteric? Cooperative? The rhetoric of "'us' and 'them," thus invoked, Peatling seems to place them naturally at odds.

"The naturalization of the nation that takes place in a variety of activities is at once performative and political, occluding other ways of viewing the world with are intrinsically equally valid" (Peatling, 2004)

- Peatling rejects the "perennialist" or "primordialst" theory, that considers the formation of national identity to predate any formal State-making. 
- Ethnosymbolism: "What gives nationalism its power are the myths, memories, traditions, and symbols of ethnic heritages and the ways in which a _popular living_ past has been, and can be, rediscovered and reinterpreted by modern nationalist intelligentsias."
- "Modernist" : National identities can be explicitly constructed; e.g. State-theorized depictions of Soviet identity following the Russian Revolution. "Nations are thus seen to be 'constructed essentially from above'." (Peatling, 2004, p. 37)
