## An Unordered List of Esoteric Approaches to Library Work

### The Library Is A Place
Libraries -- whether physical, digital, or otherwise -- are places, and as such we should consider the feeling of being in them. What is the experience of being in this place like? On the first visit? The tenth? The hundredth? 

### The Reader's Time Is Beans

### Help The Reader Experience the Miracle of New Thought


### The library is a fragile organism

The complete devaluation of technologies (and the value of the labororers who worked with them) used to take a lifetime; Think Linotype's decades-long drawdown. But in my lifetime, I've watched, like a nature film in fast-forward, entire workforces sprout, flower, and decay in the span of a decade or less. With the advent of AI tools for image and audio generation, I fully expect the career for which I dilligently trained in my 20s will no longer be viable. 


### Some questions to ask the reader

- How did you hear about this place?
- What are you thinking about?
- What are you dreaming about?
- What do you like to do in your spare time?
- Do you have domain expertise in an area outside of this query?
