In the US, DDC and LCC enjoyed what businesspeople call [the First Mover Advantage](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/first-mover-advantage/), and by Colon Classification's \[CCS\] publication in 1933, were already firmly established in academic and professional settings. "The people who ran the libraries... were unlikely to pay attention to anyone proposition the adoption of another classification." (Comaromi, 1992)

But the UK's library system was established later; And arguably didn't become truly accessible until the Carnegie foundation's efforts (the number of UK libraries trippled between 1890 and 1910) and the 1919 Library Act. (R. 1931, p.212; see Context: UK) Europe also saw the paralell development of the "Documentation" field, which failed to become widely established in the US, and includes its own theorhetical and practical classification-related literature.

Similarly, formal library education began earlier in the US; And in the early 20th c. in the UK, library education was just beginning to become established in formal college settings (like UCL). Hence, R.'s landmark technical works, CCS and the _Prolegomena_, were hanlded by US and UK pedagogy along rather different lines. I believe† this difference largely accounts for the narrow US scholarly emphasis on _The Five Laws_ exclusively as a first-principles work.

In Europe, a larger number of classification schemes were being actively used and developed: DDC and LCC shared space with Bibliographic Classification, Documentation-related classificaiton, and others. Hence, UK library pedagogy more readily absorbed CCS in classification curricula, _in both theorhetical and practical spheres_. (i.e., for discussion of facet analysis, comparison between different systems, and as an option a new library may want to use.)

The UK also had the benefit of Bernard Ira Palmer, who appears as one of a few minor Western characters in R. and Y.'s memoirs. Palmer was a UK librarian who served in the Royal Armoured Corps (e.g. tanks) during WWII, and was luckily stationed near Madras. A huge fan of R.'s _Prolegomena_, Palmer frequented the U. Madras library and became fast friends with R. As Harrison (1992) clarifies, after the war, Palmer became the Education Officer of \[LAUK\], overseeing

> an ad hoc commitee of library educations, examiners and practising librarians whose remit was to revise the syllabus. Palmer saw to it that prominence in the new syllabus was given to the study of R.'s _Five Laws of Library Science_, the Colon Classification, and chain indexing.

Later, Palmer and A. J. Wells' book _Fundamentals of Library Classification_ (1951), which "immediately became recommended reading for students," was described as "a restatement of the CCS principles which focuses them on classification by DDC." (Harrison, 1992)

But in the US, DDC and LCC's establishment relegated CCS _to the theorhetical sphere only_. As Comaromi (1992) states, "a few \[US\] library schools examined his ideas in classification courses. What was learned did not survive graduation." Further,

> R.'s thought, particularly his Five Laws of Library Science, was discussed by \[US\] library scholars during the middle third of the century--usually favourably. The discussions, however, did not engender much action. ...
> The dialogue between \[R. and Henry E. Bliss\] was touched upon by Susan Bury in her comparison of \[CCS and Bibliographic Classification\]. But as neither classification was used in the United States, the... thoughts of both men fell upon infertile sole. (ibid)

Adding some quantitative data to this, Garfield (1992) quotes a study (Thomas 1977) that found

> of 48 \[ALA-accredited\] schools, 73 per cent (35 school) include facet theory in their curricula. But of these, only 20 per cent (seven schools) cover in any depth. And although 50 per cent of schools include \[CCS\]... only about eight per cent (two schools) conduct any practice exersizes in it.

Further, as Fink & Haung (1992) found, CCS and _Prolegomena_ were R.'s most-cited-or-reviewed works in US and Canadian LIS publications, comprising 18.9% and 17.2% of the 122 citations (respectively), with _The Five Laws_ in third at 9.8%. This throws some unknowns into the mix -- Did 20th c. Canadian LIS pedagogy skew more toward US or UK frameworks? -- but suggests† that North American LIS scholars primarily associated R. with classification, and thus (from a pedagogic perspective) the theorhetical sphere.<sup>Comaromi</sup>

In this volume, we find Cochrane (1992) first encountered R.'s work "in a course on the _History and Theory_ of Cataloguing at the University of Chicago; \[emphesis mine\]" While Finks (1992) encountered "the 'Five Laws' in the introductory survey course and \[CCS\] in the advanced cataloguing course." As LIS educators, Cochrane has "written these five statements on every blackboard in every classroom where I have taught;" and Finks regularly uses "the 'Five Laws' as a basis for my efforts to teach the _philosophical foundations_ of the work we do. \[emphasis mine\]."

And already in 1992, we find an academic pushing back against the reductive framing of R.'s work in the western literature: Humphrey notes that "so much had been written about" the "fascinating" and "esoteric" aspects of R.'s first-principles work in the _Five Laws_ "that I believed his fundamental influence on librarinship in his own country may have been neglected." Or as Gauri (1992) comments, "Despite his towering and voluminous contribution, he remains somewhat obscure to the American librarianship and studied with an element of curiosity in library schools."

It is my opinion† that this initial-and-continued placement of R.'s work into the theorhetical sphere in US LIS pedagogy has conditioned students (and hence, future scholars) to overlook the vast practical implications of _The Five Laws_' engagement with political advocacy and experimental literary techniques.

† You may notice my unusual reliance on waffly diction in this section: The footwork to _demonstrate_ this skewing of R.'s work toward the theorhetical sphere in the US is frankly beyond my timeframe here... But if any enterprising MLIS students are looking for a thesis topic, a longituidnal analysis and comparison of US and UK syllabi (ideally both quantitative and qualitative) will likely reveal fascinating insights.

**Camaromi**: Ironically, as Camaroni (1992) states, DDC began incoroporating more faceting features beginnin with the 17th ed. in 1965, and formally introducing the term "faceting" with the 19th in 1979. Hence, we arrive at the present day where facet analysis is once again deeply practical to US librarianship, but can be framed under the auspices of DDC rather than CCS for maximum practicality.
