# Working (revision) - Context Part 2 : England 1800-1924


## England Hatches into the Modern Age

### The New Poor Law

At the opening of the 19th c., the shock of the industrial revolution was still coursing through England. In 1801, 44% of the population lived in cities; By 1911, the population had roughly quadrupled and this share was up to 89%. (Goodman, 2013, p. 200)

England faced a nexus of problems grinding the living conditions of the working and lower classes into the dirt: Food shortages; Densifying cities with unsanitary conditions; Dropping incomes from unregulated industry; And worsening health from hazordous factory work and air pollution so severe it "could be withstood only by the hardiest \[plant\] species." (Goodman, 2013, p. 187) <note>The city's proliferation of Plane trees and Rhodedenrons are a vestige of this period.<note> "Crime had risen sevenfold in England and Wales between 1805 and 1842, despite savage punishments. Its principal victims were the lower classes." Working men took to drink to endure the harshness of their enrivonment: "Between 1810 and 1840 consumption of gin rose from a gallon per head per year to a gallon and a a half." (Heffer, 2022 p. 113)

Though the ownership classes and aristoracy benefited from unregulated capitalism, the well-meaning among them saw these worsening conditions and pushed the government to act -- but how? Political franchisement at the turn of the century was available only to landowning men (TK TK stipulations here?); both in the context of voting and of governance, for which no stipend was provided. Enamoured with the new Utilitarian philosophy, laissez-faire policies, and individualism generally, these upper-class legislators enacted the 1834 New Poor Law, "\[overturning\] a system dating back to the time of Elizabeth I," and mandating citizens enter a Workhouse to recieve government relief. (Charing, 1995; Besley, Coate, & Guinnane, 2001) These laws were passed broadly ignoring any input from lower-class representatives, who advocated for very different outcomes.

> Workhouses were large, centralized institutions, built and maintaned by the Poor Law Union and staffed with more or less professional employees. Workhouse advocates wanted to insure that the pauper had a less enjoyable life... than another poor person who was not recieving relief... \[which\] was accomplished not only by making workhouse inmates labor, but by enforcing a strict regime of waking hours, limiting inmates to a monotonous diet, and forbidding small pleasures such as tobacco. (Besley, Coate, & Guinnane, 2001, p. 10)

Consignment to the workhouse was often the beginning of a torturous attrition of the body, as the food provided there could easily be below caloric replacement, given the required labor. A recipe for "Mrs. Beeton's Useful Soup for Benevolent Purposes calls for 4 pounds of beef trimmings, 4 pounds of pearl barley, about 8 pounds of onions and a sprinkling of herbs to make ten gallons of soup." (Goodman, 2013, p. 168) The paucity of food in general for the lower classes was a significant problem in the early 19th c.; Compared to skeletons from the Medieval period, Victorians were typically two inches shorter. (Goodman, 2013, p. 170) The 1845 Potato Blight exacerbated the food shortage in England, and "by most estimates" killed over a million in Ireland, where potatoes "formed well over 80 per cent of the people's total diet". (Goodman, 2013, p.164) 

But staying out of the Workhouse wasn't easy either. In an environment of largely unrestrained Capitalism, employers hired and fired as needed; Meaning workers could no longer plan for a stable income. To make ends meet, most working-class families expected their children would be earning a wage by age ten, and in extreme cases as early as five. This was the case in both rural and urban areas, and all lines of work (agriculture, factories, offices, etc). Legilsation eventually begin to curb child labor's most visibly problematic aspects, particularly in the mines, and textile mills where "from 1835 up to 1850, half of all the workers... were under the age of 18." Even so, a blind eye was often turned to restrictions, and child labor was common through the end of the century. (Goodman, 2013, p. 197)

Both children and adults navigated nightmarishly unsafe work environments: Factories were populated by ungaurded machinery that could easily maim or kill; Agricultural machinery was typically pulled by livestock that could spook and bolt; Dangerous chemicals were used with no worker safegaurds; etc etc etc etc. Workplace safety legislation arrived piecemiel throughout the century, often in forms we'd now consider parodically baseline. (Goodman, 2013, p.197)






### Chartism and the 1867 Second Reform Act

Recall the makeup of Britain's government: No one to whom the New Poor Law applied had any influence in the legislative process. Two years prior, the government had made its first halting steps toward a more democratic system with the 1832 Reform Act (which itself was hotly contested in Parliament). The Act included reapportionment of MPs and the creation of new constituencies; But enfranchisment was broadened only a smidgen, to include "small landowners, tenant farmers, and shopkeepers," and "all \[male\] householders who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more" (UK Parliament, n.d.a), leaving "five out of six working men without a vote." (Heffer, 2022, p. 114)

The one-two punch of these 1832 and 1834 Acts turned up the heat on simmering progressive movements, most notably the [Radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicals_(UK)). A few rounds of obligitory leftist intercene bickering led to the emergence of the Chartism movement in 1836. (National Archives, 2022) Chartism takes its name from the People's Charter, "which listed six main aims," and was presented to Parliament thrice, in 1839, 1842, and 1848. (National Archives, 2022)

> 
	- a vote for all men (over 21)
    - secret ballot
    - no property qualification to become an MP
    - payment for MPs
    - electoral districts of equal size
    - annual elections for Parliament
    (National Archives, 2022)

Chartist rhetoric at times explicitly advocated for armed revolution, and occasionally led to direct action like strikes, sabotage, and rioting. The movement ebbed and surged along with the working class' economic fortunes, and "was most active between 1838 and 1848." (National Archives, 2022) Though the Charist movment sputtered out, pressure for male suffrage persisted, until the 1867 Second Reform Act was passed "by an aristocracy largely paralysed with fear at the prospect of an assault on its property and status, and an uprising by the working class." (Heffer, 2022 p. 114) The resulting changes "roughly doubled the electorate in England and Wales from one to two million men," along with a smattering of general districting changes. (UK Parliament, n.d.b)

But paternal classism still ran strong, and as Parliament started into the inevibility of expanding sufferage, a wave of panic about the educational state of the electorate washed over the chamber. The general sentiment was nicely summarized by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, who described the Second Reform Act as "the call-in of new supplies of blockheadism, gullibility, bribeability, emenability to beer and balderdash" into the political process. (Heffer, 2022, p. 579) Such a shift, insisted MP Robert Lowe (more politely), meant that public education had "become paramout to every other questions that has been brought before us. From the moment that you entrust the masses with power their education becomes an absolute neccesity." (Heffer, 2022, p. 413)

Thus, a small cadre of ministers and select committees who'd been compiling reports, forming reccomendations, and drafting un-read bills were suddenly pulled from the political hinterlands into the spotlight; The resulting legilsation enabled a nationaled school system and established the Publica Library System.


<note>Lowe is a complex character, now often reviled for his pedagogical insistance on "The Three Rs" at the expense of broader perspectives and his severe resentment of the lower classes.</note>























## Education

In the first half of the 19th c., British primary education was in a bad state.<note>Scottland</note> There was scarecly any national education policy or oversight; And with the exception of reformatory and workhouse schools, each school was a privately-run endeavor. In 1855, one MP estimated that only one in eight children attended school. No standards existed curicula, teachers, or administrators; An 1851 survey of school headmasters found them a motley crew of mostly down-on-their-luck tradesmen getting by while they gameplanned the next step. Factories employing children were required to have schools; The level of instruction here was aggressively remedial. (Heffer, 2022, p. 419-421)

<note>
Scottland: Interestingly, this state of affairs applied mainly to England and Wales; Scottland had actually gotten its act together on Education back in the 17th c., with a robust system of public education from primary school through college. (Heffer, 2022, p. 413)</note>

The state of British higher education in the early 1800s was similarly bleak: English colleges focused almost exclusively on classics; Teachers were underpaid and often nepotistically-appointed; And there was little in the way of academic standards. At Eaton, a student's prestige was gained or lost on the cricket field or rowing circuit rather than in the classroom. (Heffer, 2022, p. 451) "An Oxford examiner testified" that of the 168 candidates who took the Univeristy Examinations, 47 failed, and 43 of those "'failed so universally as to show that they were "utterly unfit to to undergo any examination whatsoever."'" (Heffer, 2022, p. 450)

In 1861, Parliament began an inquirry, headed by Lord Clarendon, into the state of England's nine leading universities, "Eaton, Harrow, Charterhouse, Wstminster, St Paul's Whichester, Rugby, Shrewsbury, and Merchant Taylors." (Heffer, 2022, p. 446) The commission's daming 1864 report led to several curiccula reforms madates, and culminated in the 1868 Public Schools Act, wich took the nine universities "out of the hands of either the government of the Church and made the independent." (Heffer, 2022, p. 416) <note>This is the linguistic origin of why public universities in England are viewed as more prestigious than private ones.</note> In the lead-up to the 1868 act, Clarendon and his supporter Prince Albert needed to make the case that State control of education was neither overreach or "akin to pauperism." (Heffer, 2022, p. 467) 

Thereafter, collegiate administrative duties were increasingly divorced from (mainly Anglican) religious orders, expediting a shift towards rationalist pedagogy that had been slowly underweigh since the 1840s. (Heffer, 2022. p. 446) Unviersities began offering modern langagues like French and German, and introduced science and math courses. As Oxford don Goldwin Smith later reflected, with these changes, "Liberalism soon took the practical shape of an effort to reform and emancipate the university, to strike off the fetters of medieval statues from it and from its Colleges, set it from the predominance of ecclesiasticism, recall it to its propper work, and restore it to the nation" (Heffer, 2022, p. 448) 

Reforms to public education at the primary level arrived with the 1870 Education Act, which created school boards; the 1881 Mundella Act, which "compell\[ed\] attendance for children aged between five and ten"; And the Fee Grant Act of 1891, which rendered this mandatory education free of charge. But the prioritizing of adult education makes clear the Parlimentary concern with the eloctorate. (Heffer, 2022, p. 415)







### Libraries

From the outset, Parliament saw education as extending beyond the formal classroom. Through the 1930s, parliamentary concern about the state of the lower classes led to a series of commissions aiming to figure out how to discourage drinking and encourage pursuits like physical fitness and cultural edification. Though the reccomendations therefrom "produced few tangible results, one recurring theme emerged in the investigations--a belief in the maniforld virtues of education." (Fletcher, 1996)

Prior to the mid-1800s, the expense of printed material meant library subscription fees were feasible only for the wealthy. But with the dropping price of print, by the midcentury, a proliferation of smaller libraries, often associated with "various institutions of rational recreation"  like "the Mechanics Institute... temprance socities, trade unions clubrooms, the various literary and scientific socities, \[and\] several of the larger cotton mills" were accessible for the working class. (Hewitt, 2000, p. 65) Not only for educational purposes, these spaces often functioned for political organization, including the Chartism movement; And "the most powerful forces tending to promote free and public libraries... originated in the developing pressures experienced in growing urban communities" (Fletcher, ref. Jones)

William Ewart headed the 1849 Select Committee on Libraries, and used his earlier 1845 Museums Act as a stepping stone for the Public Libraries and Museums Act of 1850. This first act was focused primarily on land acquisition; Two additional Public Library Acts in 1855 and 1866 rounded out the resources needed to fully implement a national library system. And though the rhetoric around uplifting the poor and working classes proved historically stickier, Libraries could also serve as a venue for civic pride and beautification for the upper classes; Particularly in well-to-do outlying cities, who industrialization had bolstered already established economies. (Fletcher, 1996) 

Sequentially, these 1850, 1855 and 1866 Acts loosened requirements to apply for State library funds: In a city's population, from 10,000 residents, to 5,000, to no requirements at all; And for local measure passage, from a two-thirds to a simple majority. Even so, these proposals weren't always a shoe-in: Sufferage at this point was still limited to the upper classes, whose incentives didn't always align with the conceptual aim of the library program. As Fletcher (1996) notes, "for much of the ninteenth century central government was not the focal point of educational activity." These government actions were merely one of many education-promoting and -providing efforts being explored in, e.g., "Anglican and Voluntary groups;" and the significant historiographic focus on legislation is perhaps due to a backwards projection of present-day educational frameworks. (Fletcher, 1996)







### Sidebar: Libraries and the Formation of National Identity.

For example, it wasn't until the 1855 act that tax funding was allocated for building the library collections: It was expected that well-resourced members of the community would donate or purchase works for the library systems. This of course raises questions about what kinds of book were provided, and why. "The structure of libraries and library management often reflected religious affiliations, with local churches, bishops and clergy often represented on library committees" during the formative period of 1850-1919. (Peating, 2004)

Peatling (2004) argues that Libraries were instrumental in the formation and consolidation of an English national identity. Libraries play an essential "role in popularizing images of the world onto which constructions of nations, often established nations, are hardcoded... even by ostensibly non-political arefacts such as maps and landscapes." (p. 36) A library's classification system creating or reinforcing boundaries; Not only in fields of study (e.g., mathematics, music, spelunking), but in the idea of nationalities. (For example, in 19th c. England, presenting the public with section of books from The British Empire presents a specific view of the world; A more modern example may be surveying where books about the Crimea are shelved in Russian and Ukrainian libraries, or books about Taiwain in China.)

Rejecting "primordialist" interpretations, Peatling instead argues Libraries forwarded a British identity along "modernist" lines; <note>frameworks</note> That is, suppliers of book stock and library administrators understood they were intentionally demonstrating and promoting a specific British identity. Peatling suggests the following five lines of inquiry for future researchers looking to examine a library's roles in the formation of a national identity: (blockquote these:)

1. Library law and propogation of libraries by the state of local élites
2. Particular discursive constructions of nations articulated by library administrators and commentators
3. Censorship and stock control
4. Targeted indoctrination of particular sets of readers,
5. And architecture, display and commemoriation in libraries. (Peatling, 1996)

Initial scans of material relating to Ranganathan's perspectives of the role of the Library Movement in India appear to indicate he was keenly aware of a library system's role in national identity formation. Will this surface in the _Five Laws_? Only time will tell.

<note>
Peatling's work is a vociferous argument for the integration of more identity politics into library history; Two decades later, most of what she's arguing for seems common practice. Peatling's work is now somewhat dated; In the intervening two decades, the type of identity politics and intersectional theories of power she's advocating for have become commonplace in cultural research. Her discussion of then-current work into how "contradictory discourses can emanate even from national museums" seems to be table-stakes now for currators responsible for creating museum exhibit's explanitory text. Peatling is interested specifically in intercene divisions over the historiographic examination of the UK as a whole or the "four nations" model; which is beyond my scope.

<note>
	- Peatling rejects the "perennialist" or "primordialst" theory, that considers the formation of national identity to predate any formal State-making. 
	- Ethnosymbolism: "What gives nationalism its power are the myths, memories, traditions, and symbols of ethnic heritages and the ways in which a _popular living_ past has been, and can be, rediscovered and reinterpreted by modern nationalist intelligentsias."
	- "Modernist" : National identities can be explicitly constructed; e.g. State-theorized depictions of Soviet identity following the Russian Revolution. "Nations are thus seen to be 'constructed essentially from above'." (Peatling, 2004, p. 37)

### End sidebar

One notable example of urban enthusiasm was the Manchester Free Library, the first library founded under the Act in 1852; which was thoroughly covered in the press, and maintains a bountiful archive of its founding materials. (Hewitt, 2000) Manchester had earned the nickname "shock city" for its rappid industrialization, and was the center of England's burgeoning cotton industry. Its deep-pocketed upper class heavily subsidized the library's construction and collection; and the library was immediately and continually used by the city's working class. (Hewitt, 2000)






























(Inititally, the approval of Library funding was contingent on nearby or new schools providing practical classes using the library's materials.)








A few key passages were the 1870 Education Act, which created school boards; the 1881 Mundella's Act which made attendance compulsory for children aged 5 to 10; And the 1891 Fee Grant Act, which made this education free. (Heffer, 2022, p. 415-416)








































































## Layers

The Vicotirans were a people of layers -- but I actually _don't mean this metaphorically_: They were stacked with cotton, flannel, silk, and wool; Combinations, crinolines, corsets, drawers, chemises, petticoats, vests, bonnets, bodices, etc. etc. etc.

In inhabiting the changing dress and living patterns of various 19th c. decades, Gonzo Historian Ruth Goodman notes how clothing alters one's motion through space and performance of various tasks. Edging a field with a sickle, for example, involves different postures and muscle groups in 1870s and modern dress: An 1870s corset encourages an upright position, where the boning and midsection reinforcement counterballances the motion of the tool; Whereas modern dress encourages a stooped position with more lateral motion. (Goodman, 2013, p. 92) Simply sitting down requires adjustment when wearing a crinolette or bustle:

> Anything that stuck out predominantly at the back required a diagonal approach to chairs. Images of the fashionable lady of the 1870s show that she perched on the very front of the chair at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees, leaning slightly forward. It is a very elegant look, but also an eminently sensible one (Goodman. 2013, p. 76)

The increased volume of skirts following the 1856 introduction of Crinolines induced a shifting of home decor to higher places to avoid any accidental knocking-over; While the reactionarily-narrow skirts of the 1885 required a new approach to walking: 

> The trick, I have found, is to adopt a slightly circular gait. At each step, it pays to move the foot outwards, describing a semicircle, rather than just stepping forwards. This ensures that the fabric has no chance to form any folds or tucks that further constrict movement, keeping it at all times taught. (Goodman. 2013, p. 77)
























## Propaganda by the Deed

As if U.S. political commentators haven't emptied entire buckets of the word "unprecedented" over the past decade, this month saw two assasination attempts on a major party candidate in as many weeks. But of course, careful students of history will point out attacks on politicians were not only common in the US, but absolutely rife in Europe during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
