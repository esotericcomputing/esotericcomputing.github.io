# Working - ALIS Centenary Issue


## Overview

> Assembled in its pages are eleven invited studies by LIS scholars, both from India and from abroad, that discuss various facets of Ranganathan’s thought and its enduring effect upon LIS theory and practice. These papers can be divided into three thematic tranches. The first of these deals with Ranganathan the man and his thought, the second examines his continuing influence in LIS, and the third considers Ranganathan and his legacy in light of the latest advances in the practice of information system design. These three thematic clusters can be roughly mapped to the three dimensions of time–the past, the present, and the future. In this sense, they collectively convey the message that Ranganathan was an LIS thinker whose intellectual contributions–a product of a specific time and place–have much to teach us not only today but well into tomorrow as well.

## Soul, Subtle Body, Gross Body: S.R. Ranganathan’s Ontology of the Book in (Its) Context(s) (Dousa, 2024)

Beginning around 1948 and culminating with his 1952 publication of three inter-related volumes, <note>_Library Book Selection_, _Social Bibliography, or Physical Bibliography for Librarians_, and _Social Education Literature for Authors, Artists, Publishers, Teachers, Librarians and Governments_</note>Ranganathan developed an ontology of the book that presages many later bibliographic frameworks (particularly FRBR's "Work, Expression, Manifestation, Instance" model for Group 1 entities, outlined in 1998). R.'s ontology, however, was adapted from classical hindu philosophy concerning each individual's (_jīva_) Soul (_ātma_), Subtle Body (_sūkṣma-śarīra_) and Gross Body (_sthūla-śarīra_).

- The Hindu concept of _jīva_ is "Perhaps best glossed as 'the empirical self', a _jīva_ is a living individual being that stands in a firstperson ('I') relationship to the world."
- A individual carries with them a Soul, which is an exclusively metaphysical entity, existing outside physical concerns of time and space; The _ātma_ is "eternal, indestructible, and immutable, and so forms the existential and spiritual core of the _jīva_."
- The Subtle Body exists in the material world, but is made of a "finer" substance than the molecules, atoms, and quarks which form the stuff of tables, chairs, bones, flowers, (etc). The Subtle Body "encompasses the mind (_antaḥkaraṇa_), including the intellect or cognitive capacity (_buddhi_), the ability to feel a sense of individuality or ego (_ahaṁkāra_), and the faculty of processing sensory data (_manas_)."
- The Gross body is an individual's physical form.<note>The Causal Body (_kārana-śarīra_) acts as the bridge between the imaterial Soul and the material Subtle Body, but is not considered R.'s ontology.</note>

In the cycle of samsara, the Gross Body's failure ends one physical lifetime, while the Soul and Subtle Body are reincarnated. Because its concerned with the mind and voluntary actions, the Subtle Body carries an individual's karma, and is responsible for its acrual and discharge between physical lifetimes.

Most often, Ranganathan presents a three-part ontology of the book, but occasionally condenses this down to two. The three-part ontology is presented as follows:

- A book's Soul is its "thought-content:" The ideas the author is working with and communicating, along with its aboutness, subject matter, the directionality of its arguments, and what we'd shorthand in 2024 to vibe.
- Its Subtle Body are the semiotics: The actual language used to translate the ideas and vibes into a work of literature; Syntax and diction; And its illustrations or figures.
- Its Gross Body is its physical form: The binding, paper weight, typesetting, font size, etc.

In the two-part ontology, the close relationship between the Soul and Subtle Body becomes a conjoining; mirroring the relationship to a _jīva_'s bodies during samsara:

- The Soul and Subtle Body constitute a book's ideas and expression, characterized here as the "work."
- The Gross Body constitutes a book's physical form, characterized here as the "document."

In the way that the Soul and Subtle Body can cycle through a procession of gross bodies, a "work" can be transmitted into various "documents" (e.g., editions) and still retain its essential individuality. This coupling of a book's ideas and their expression emphesizes that, if one wants to write a book, expressing ideas through writing is the only way to do so. (To put this more generally: Communicating ideas is the only way to communicate them. Even conceptual art is typically "set down" in some capacity (e.g. Nam June Paik's fluxus scores), Even short-duration ephemeral works must be brought into existance.) Many writers would probably argue the writing process itself is integral to the formation and refinement of a book's "thought-content." R. "underscores the unity between thought and its linguistic or pictorial expression by stating that 'the expression and thought are inseparable,' citing the opening lines of the Kalidasa’s epic poem _Raghuvamsa_."


### Some thoughts

Modern digital formats add an interesting wrinkle to this. On the one hand, there are meaningful distinction between a "work" as expressed in plain text, a pdf file, or in HTML; And these distinctions seem to place digital formats within the Gross Body / Document position in the ontology.






### A criticism

Dousa dismissively describes the Gross Body as a mere platform for the Soul and Subtle Body:

> Of the three concepts, that of the gross body, or _sthūla-śarīra_, requires no comment, for, in both models, it serves simply as the physical substrate of the entity in question: just as the gross body is the physical body of a living being like a man, horse, or mosquito, so is the gross body of a book simply the physical object containing text and illustrations.

R. likewise suggests seeking out healthy, strong, atractive bodies: Heavyweight bindings and study pages that can withstand frequent circulation, and fascinating covers that insprire "bibliophilia."

I take issue with these diminishings of the Gross Body -- but this needs to be prefaced that my issues seem to extend beyond the internal logic of the central Hindu metaphore.

 I am a mondaist; I believe the mind _begins_ in the body; I am fasc

I happen to inhabit a Gross Body with a few distinctive features which effect my "firstperson ('I') relationship to the world." Before I was properly diagnosed and began my antidepressant medication; Before I was properly diagnosed and began cognative behavioral practices to address my autism; And before I began an athletic practice which bolsters both of these, my subjective experience of the world was radically different and (frankly) way worse than it is now. 





















## S R Ranganathan: Making of the Man and His Method (Satija & Gupta, 2024)

Along with a useful biographical sketch, this paper touches on several aspects of R.'s work and philosophy proving to be invaluable to my general line of inquiry.



### Practicum, Science

"\[R.\] was of the considered opinion that the practice of a discipline, as a rule, precedes its theory. Science is mostly empirical in that phenomena provide the inductive ground from which logical conclusions flower." 

I arrive at my MLIS degree in midlife, with the mixed blessing of a meandering path winding through music, art, mental illness, and several years' experience in polar opposite library environments: The deeply practical milleiu of a large academic institution, and the cozy, freewheeling splendor of the Prelinger Library. Most of SJSU's coursework comports with the former; But the later's ethos of sociability and experimentaiton easily illuminate the limitations of formal "scientific" library frameworks.

R. entered the library world

> At the very moment that our budding discipline was designated as a science, \[and\] sceptics raised doubts about whether it indeed deserved such a status. The term was even ridiculed. But the handling and the treatment of the subject by Ranganathan has vindicated, beyond any shadow of doubt, the conception and stand of the Chicago School in 1930s, which held that librarianship can be treated as in a scientific way.

("Designated" by whom? Why is this sentence in passive voice? Who decides what's a science? ISO? NISO? Is there a classification scheme for sciences? If so, who designed it, and who's in charge of revisions? <ins>Would library work be less meaningful if it was an _art_ instead of a _science_</ins>? Is robust classification simply a neccesary outgrowth of the amount of material published? Historians generally dislike counterfactuals, but would libraries not have arrived at some alternative strategy? And would it be neccesary this strategy was scientific in nature?)

Prior to his development of the Five Laws, R. inhaled the literature of the day, and finding them "inadequate in their approach;"

> His discontent led him to resolve that, when he had returned to India, he would replace the theoretically weak and foundationless structure of library practice with one that was systematic and based on sound principles.

The "unorganised state of the Madras University Lirbary" provided an ideal sandbox for experimentation with his ideas in a practical setting; _The Five Laws_ thus arises from both theorhetical and practical work. The ideas underlying the book were first presented at a series of "vacation lectures in December 1928" at Madras University.


### Intellection, Intuition, _Ekavakyata_, & Mysticism

R. embraced the concept of _Ekavakyata_, a "principle of integrative interpretation and interconnectedness":

> The basic premise of _Ekavakyata_ is the unity of all knowledge. The systems approach is a weaker form of this principle; mysticism and intuition are its main instruments. Its core tenets are that all entities in this universe are interconnected with one another and that, therefore, one should not view individual entities in isolation.

R. believe that knowledge arose both from "intellection" (empiracal reasoning), and intuition -- the later being "a form of knowing that is entirely independent of sensory perception and ratiocinative deduction, and so allows the person possessing it to experience entities in the world in a way that 'transcends the space-time matrix'" 

Satija & Gupta relate R.'s annecdote of visiting a department store in London, where he encounters a Meccano Set <span class=tr>\[ed: Branded as 'Erector Set' in the US\]</span>. Observering its modular design, he had an intuitive flash that "just as the Meccano Set allows for the combination and recombination of different elements to form new wholes, so new subjects could be formed by disentangling, combining, and recombining these granules of knowledge." Colon Classification's pure faceted structure represents the intellectual extrapolation of this intuitive experience.

> R. view\[ed\] his professional discoveries as spiritual experiences rooted in mysticism and intuition. As he puts it:
> "\[Mysticism\] falls within a large debatable territory between sciences and philosophy, between theory and practice, which has been very little explored and is still terra incognita to all intents and purposes. Its difficulties are immense; from that wide and wild No Man's Land between Sciences and Humanities [...] Time may come when mysticism and spiritual experience may be the very keystone of the arch, and serve to complete the full growing circle of organised human knowledge. It will then synthesise all sciences and humanities and become the basis of a truer spiritual outlook than we can possibly have in the ignorance and confusion of our present state of knowledge.""

#### Comment
Any serious discussion of R.'s intellectual ideas should -- MUST! -- be viewed in this integrative light: That is, Ranganathan's Library Science is not the root node of a nested structure, but rather exists in a FACETED, NON-HEIRARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MYSTICISM.

<ins>Current digital library systems are overwhelmingly designed for intellection alone. How might we design a digital system for intuition instead? How might we incorporate more intuitive options into existing interfaces?</ins>
