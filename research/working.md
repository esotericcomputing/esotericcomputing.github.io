# 2024-10-12 - The Five Laws of Library Science: Book Summary

## Context

The two previous research reports (India and England) cover this at length; I'll briefly summarize here.

The British and Indian public library systems R. writes about emerged in the early 19th c., as part of the "Adult Education" movement; Which itself arose in England as a Utilitarian/Individualist upper-class response to political agitation from below, demainding expanded suffrage and alternate means of addressing declining living conditions from rapid urbanization and industrialization. Libraries had existed in the UK for centuries, primarily attached to religious institutions and private collages and archival in nature; With the declining cost of print, private libraries transitioned from upper-class- to working-class-accessible 


Because of its economic value to the British Empire, technological and administrative techniques were often deployed concurrently in India; Public Education included.




## The Vibe; Target Audience

After wading through the morass of modern-day academic writing on Victorian England, I was steeling myself for a brutal, antiquated slog -- But no! R.'s writing style is casual, disarming, occasionally humorous, peppered with slang<note>examples</note>; In short, _The Five Laws_ is a general-audience work. Refreshingly free from the straightjacket of APA or Chicago, R. emphesizes BIG IDEAS WITH ALL-CAPS and liberally-scattered eclamation points. The work as a whole has a collagey feel from its origin as a series of disparate lectures and essays stitched into a whole; A handful of sections are rendered dramaturgically, as conversations between anthropomorphized concepts like the siblings "The Rule of Least Cost and Least Space" and their "Law" counterparts; And the fourth chapter includes a draft bill for the establishment of a public library system in the Madras. The current edition <note>by Ess Ess Publications for Randra Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science<note> is a scanned facsimily rather than a digital re-setting, meaning the original's inconsistent, sometimes flawed typography is delightfully preserved.

Owing to its international scope (the third chapter in particular), the work would likely prove useful to anyone looking to establish a public library system; But the text is often focused on the particulars of the Madras; And the assumed reader is Indian, English-educated, and likely in some position of influence over policy at governmental or educational institutions. 





## The Five Laws

R.'s Five Laws are mostly revelaed rather than declared; That is, they derive from his study of flourishing public library systems and personal experimentation at the Madras Univeristy Library. But R. also brings his Hindu grounding to the process, often closing chapters by emphesizing the social goals of the public library movement by quoting scripture. The Laws are framed sequentially: Libraries must shift their view of book stocks from "preservation" to "use"; Books suitable for the whole public should be stocked; Wayfinding, staff services, and internal processes should be optimized; And careful forethought employed in planning for the future. The disproportionate amount of ink R. expends on the second law reflects the stage in which he saw the Indian library context, and the changes he advocates for its improvement. (Sequentially, by percent of pagecount: %17.5, 53.8%, 8.9%, 10.6%, and 8.2%.)





### 1. BOOKS ARE FOR USE!

R. begins with a history of library design and function; From the medieval "chained" style designed to preserve rare, laborious mand-made material, to the current "open stacks" style designed to enthusiastically circulate affordable, mass-produced print. But beyond these physical aspects, he identifies policy decisions as roadblocks to "use," sometimes in subtle ways:

- Building libraries in out-of-the-way locations;
- Limiting their open hours to minimize patron use;
- Designing their stacks and reading spaces for storage rather than human navigation and comfortable study;
- And staffing libraries with unenthusiastic individuals; Or in the case of primary schools, stern employees who frighten children.

As is still often the case, R. identifies libraries' meager budgets as causing many of these issues. Institutions often placed the library in whatever leftover space they could find; And R. fiercely advocates for librarian wage increases, in order to draw highly-educated, serious individuals into the field. 





### 2. EVERY READER \[THEIR\] BOOK!

This is a case where reading the full text rather than just the heading is clarifying: R. discusses indiviual staff-patron interactions mostly in the fourth and first law; What he means here is linguistically closer to "every _demographic of reader_ their book."

The arguments forwarded here are specifically collectivist; He metaphorically invokes "revolution" several times int the text -- an interesting choice for an author and audience under colonial rule! -- and begins his demographic discussion with a chapter heading "The Classes and the Masses," where he notes "The second law of library science has triumphantly planted its democratic flag in many a land having blown to pieces the black-coated barrier of exclusiveness and snobbery." (p. 89) And he sees India's delays in implementing a more robust and accessible library system as partially the fault of his upper-class peers, who he calls out in this particualrly spicy passage:

> This tragic triumph of India in her fight against the intrusion of the Second Law... is not a little due to the almost criminal apathy and neglect of duty on the part of her better placed "English-Educated" sons. They have developed an abnormal short-sight which disables them from seeing beyond their nose, at any rate beyond their privileged circle. They glibly speak of India, and her millions, when they mean only the two percent of her millions who can lisp in English. (p. 90)

Generally, R. is approaching the idea and function of a public library system in the British/Adult Education Movement mold; His goal with these chapters is to describe the widespread benefit of libraries for the Rural and Urban; The Erudite and illiterate; Seafarers and landlubbers; Men and Women. (R.'s full-throated advocacy for gender equality leads me to comfortably modify this law's language.) 
Discussing the increasing educational lag in rural areas, he astutely observes,

> \[E\]ven at the very early stage, the increasing complexities and the grave menaces attendant on the civic problems of a crowded city made out a strong plea for "education for all" and "books for all" in the case of the city folk. That inexorable mistress, necessity, however, did not, for long, put a similar pressure in regard to the country folk. What are the consequences of ignorance and lack of books are immediate in an urban area, they are latent and become visible only very late in rural areas. (p. 111)

Hence, to provide books for every reader, collective action is required (in the form of legislation and funding) in order to ensure that even readers in rural areas can be served in an appropriate manner, with traveling service. In the chapters dealing with these sections, he repeatedly makes the Utilitarian case that the ROI is good for library funding; The quick dissemination of new ideas in agriculture, machinery, etc. directly to the people doing the labor results in increased productivity.

The chapter "The Second Law and its _Digivaja_ <span class=trans>\[Universal Conquest\]</span>" is a look at the progress of library movements across the globe. This section is interesting but somewhat unrelated to my work. One enormous takeaway here is the role of Carnegie in massively kick-starting library systems in the US and UK; R. bemoans that his largess was limited mostly to the Atalantic seaboard, and chides wealthy Indian for not picking up the slack.

The chpater "The Second Law and its Implications" contains the draft legislation, and is largely focused on the differing obligations of four entities, presupposed in hierarchical order:

1. The State: Finace, legislation, and co-ordination
2. The Library Authority: Staffing and Book selection (including a broad discussion of interlibrary loan)
3. Library Staff: Shelf-arrangement, catalogging, and reference work
4. The Reader: Obeying the rules, and using the library in a way that benefits the greatest number of fellow-patrons.





### 3. EVERY BOOK ITS READER!

Once you have books, what can librarians do to ensure each book has the greatest chance of being used? Discussions include physical layout and wayfinding:

- Subject-based organizations
- Appropriate signage on stacks and shelves
- Uniform, clean, and readable spine tags on books
- Books on the top and bottom shelves are less-frequently used
- "Recent Additions" shelves because people like novelty

And external uses and promotion to draw potential patrons:

- A well-stocked newspaper and periodical room as a gateway drug into the stacks
- Cultural events to accustom non-patrons to the space
- Literacy education
- Forming relationships with local presses

In this summary's "Discussion" section, I will go into more detail on this law and the next.





### 4. SAVE THE TIME OF THE READER!

R. devotes significant ink in this and the previous chapter to the value of good catalogging. He hammers home how cross-referencing (paritcularly in the case of essay collections) and expose the contents of opaque volumes in incredibly useful ways for readers who would otherwise miss the information therein.

Interestingly, R. intertwines the "time of the reader" with "the time of the staff;" That is, adopting more efficient working practices on the staff side can lead to a smoother patron experience, and potentially free the staff up for more direct contact and assistance with readers. (The specifics here mostly relate to switching from ledger systems to card systems.)




### 5. THE LIBRARY IS A GROWING ORGANISM.

This section begins with statistical reports of the massive growth of library systems, in books, readers, and staff. R. advocates for careful forethought in planning, in all aspects of a library system; Not just square footage, but the adoption and modification of catalogging systems; Planning for different staff departments as headcount increases; Working to understand where patrons are losing time in the library process and stemming the loss' multiplication as usership increases.





## Discussion








re: Second Law -- New ideas cannot be readily made-use-of for most people any more.
















## Leaves / Pressings


It's October and I've been watching a lot of horror movies lately. Some notables:

_Wolfen_ was one of three major werewolf movies released in 1981, alongside _An American Werewolf in London_ and _The Howling_. It's less-remembered than its counterparts, but having now seen all three, I can safely say it's the best one. Genre-wise, _Howling_ and _American_ are more traditional creature-features, whereas _Wolfen_ is a police procedural with supernatural elements. Shot on location in shithole-era NYC, we follow a police detective brought back from "retirement" (read: drinking problem) as he investigates a series of murders. _Taking of Phelam 123_ vibes. Solid script and an outstanding cast (Albert Finney, Gregory Hines, Edward James Olmos, Tom Noonan, Diane Venora). Unusually for a werewolf story, the overarching metaphor is _not_ the interplay between an individual's desires and their societally-mandated repression. The wolf-view FX are excellent, featuring an early use of the in-camera technique that would be later adapted for the Predator's infared vision.

_Raiders of the Living Dead_ is as wacky as its name suggests. A tiny, cheapo film studio in New Jersey bought an unfinished zombie movie, and tacked on newly-added shots to round out the story. The final product is meandering, incomprehensible, and an absolute joy to watch. Iconically stilted line readings; terrible FX; amazing hair; hilariously obvious day-for-night shots; A legitamately incredible soundtrack; A "boy genius" who assembles a lazer gun from a VCR... this movie has it all. 10/10 -- Can't reccomend this movie highly enough.

_Oddity_ was pretty good, some legit jump scares and overwhelming tension at times.
