## On Hierarchy

I'm working to better understand the context in which Ranganathan (hereafter, R.) lived, because I find it fascinating that Colon Classification -- a pure faceted system -- arose from someone enmeshed in a deeply hierarchical social, religious, political, scientific, and educational milleiu. One might expect someone coming from this background to design a knowledge-structuring system reinforcing rather than dissipating hierarchical elements... or perhaps this non-hierarchical strategy was a direct response to this environment?



### Varna, Jati, and Caste

Trautmann (2011) provides some helpful clarification for Westerners: What we typically think of as "caste" is more properly "_varna_." The Vedic tradition (the classical system of Hindu knowledge and philosophy) divides people into four _varnas_, which specify an individual's _dharma_ <span class=trans>(Reductively: one's duty in life)</span>. The _Rig Veda_ (c. 1500-1000 bce) includes a creation story in which "the primordial being, Purusha (man or spirit), often also called Prajapti, lord of creatures, or Brahma" completes a complex act of self-sacrifice, in which 

> ...parts of his dismembered body became the things of the phenomenal universe (animals, plants, the division of time, and so forth) including human society in its four parts: From his mouth came the _brahmin_, who is associated with the sacred utterance of the Veda; from his arms, the _kshatriya_ or warrior; from his thighs, the _vaishya_ farmer and tradesman; and from his feet the _shudra_ or servant. (Trautmann, 2011, 96)

Parallel to this esoteric system, we have the boots-on-the-ground system of _jatis_ which are more akin to clans in the Western context: Extended family groups typically associated with a particular region and occupation, with complex social norms governing inter-jati marriages and economic relations.

And finally, we have the castes proper, which "number in the thousands and \[are\] generally limited in their extent to a single region of India." (Trautmann, 2011) Caste provides yet another layer of social and economic behavioral norms, which often entrap lower-caste individuals in disadvantageous circumstances. While caste-based discrimination was officially outlawed with "the constitutions adopted by India in 1949 and by Pakistan in 1953," it still remains a relevant social grouping. Repairative legal frameworks (similar to Affirmative Action in the U.S.) exist for "scheduled castes;" And in India's democracy, castes often function as political interest groups whose influence politicians and governments must be cognizant of. (Britannica, 2024; Trautmann, 2011)

R. was born in 1892, to a Tamil Brahmin family in present-day [Sirkazhi / Siyali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkazhi), [Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanjavur,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@10.0078203,77.8920773,7.04z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3baab89cea453039:0xe113da9b1f632be6!8m2!3d10.7869994!4d79.1378274!16zL20vMDFfemtt?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), then located in the [Madras Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency). His father "was a landlord holding a medium-sized property of wet land, growing paddy... a learned and culture man, used to giving _Ramayana Pravachanam_ to small audiences." (Krishnamurthy, c2014) \[A _Pravachanam_ is an educational/exegetic talk.\]<sup>0</sup>

From the outset, R.'s education was both secular and religious: It was initiated with an _Asksharabyasam_ held "on _Vijayadasami_ day in October 1897" (Krishnamurthy, c2014) \[_Asksharabyasam_ is a Vedic ceremony where the child writes their first letter and time; _Vijayadasami_ is an auspicious day marking the end of [a religious festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayadashami)\] Along with reading and writing, he also "learnt about the life teachings of _Nayanars_ (_Shaivaite Bhaktas_) and _Alwars_ (_Vaishnavaite Bhaktas_.)" from his Sanskrit teacher. (Krishnamurthy, c2014) \[_Nayanars_ and _Alwars_ are groups of Tamil Hindu saints; _Bhakta_ indicates a religious follower, i.e. the former are devotees of Shiva, the later of Vishnu.\] Though his continuing education was increasingly secular and his work deeply rationalist, he cultivated a flourishing spirituality; As an adult, he was a "multidimensional individual with seemingly contradictory traits," a "culturally orthodox Hindu" and a "rigorous scientist": (Satija & Gupta, 2024)

> Ranganathan followed the practices of his religion and found inspiration in the rich philosophical and literary traditions that had grown up around it, even if his practice grew more unconventional and, apparently, less heartfelt as he grew older. Arguably more important to him than religion as such was the concept of mysticism... \[which\] led him to dabble in occultism at certain points in his life and to accord mysticism as a central place in the disciplinary structure of main classes in the Colon classification. (Bianchini & Dousa, 2024; Broughton, 2024)




### The Company Raj

But of course, these are only the internal layers of hierarchy: There is also India's colonial structure to contend with. let's rewind a bit to gain firmer footing in our time and place.

The British East India Company \[EIC\] took control of large swathes of the subcontinent gradually, with a series of legal and martial events in the back half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Even with continual territorial expansion, India remained a patchwork of EIC control and client kingdoms (Mysore, Haidarabad, Bhutan, etc.) with varying political and economic relationships. EIC postings were initially open to single men only, any many a second or third son during the Regency sought their fortune in the Colony -- a serious gamble, considering the staggering British mortality rate from tropical diseases.

As British commercial interests, infrastructure, and governmental apparatus became more entrenched in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the political and social dynamics shifted. The European sphere was no longer a male-only space: EIC officers now relocated their families to enclaves, where upper-class Victorian social patterns were adapted for the Indian milleiu. Expanding British territory required an expanded military to secure it; But the EIC policy of enlisting indigenous soldiers (Sepoys) peaked just as the Colonial government implemented policies that destabilized the British relationship with both India's client kingdoms and its general population. Thus the stage was set for...

### The 1858 Rebellion

The EIC's penultimate executive, Governor General James Ramsey Marquis of Dalhousie (serving 1848-1856, hereafter Dalhousie) pursued intertwined strategies of infrastructural development, territorial expansion, and "unification of sovereignty." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006) We'll consider his more-successful infrastructural efforts in the next section; but his "unification of sovereignty" policies proved disastrous.

As early as 1834, the EIC had formally acknowledged a "lapse" policy, whereby client kingdoms could be seized and governed directly when a ruler had no natural heir (as opposed to the traditional practice of a ruler recognizing an adopted heir). This had been used only a few times for unusual circumstances in small kingdoms; but at the outset of his Governorship, Dalhousie began aggressively employing it to seize major kingdoms.

This shift to direct seizure coupled with Indian's continued frustration with their political disenfranchisement was the powderkeg; A spate of poorly-implemented and religiously-insensitive policies effecting the Sepoys lit the fuse. The 1858 rebellion was localized mainly in the Northern territories, but the violence was severe, often indiscriminate, and psychologically scarring. Atrocities were freely committed on both sides of the line.<sup>3</sup>


### The British Raj

British Parliament formally dissolved the EIC, and took control of India's administration directly. Following their brutal pacification of the rebellion, the Crown took a different tack on political control. The lapse policy was rescinded: Princes were once again permitted to rule as British clients, meaning "about one-third of the people of India were, until the end of the Raj, to remain under the 'indirect rule' of some 500 princes." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006) (Note the [increasingly complex maps](media/1910-map.jpg) from this period.)

British Parliament created a complex system of committees, boards (etc.), with "supreme authority" vested in the Viceroy, the title assumed by Governor General Canning following Queen Victoria's "Princes, Chiefs, and People of India'" proclamation in November 1858. (ibid, 104) The occasion of Queen Victoria's 1876 elevation to Empress of India "was intended to create a new bond between Britain and her chief imperial possession..." and the manner of its formal pronouncement (a blend of European and [Mughal court aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_(court))) was "intended above all to recognize and solidify bonds with princes, rural magnates, and urban notables." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006, 115)

But along with the diffusing and stratification of political control, the 1858 uprising also intensified racial tensions. Thereafter, the British employed the common colonial technique of favoring racial/ethnic minorities in political and martial appointments to prevent indigenous cohesion, and increasingly segregated and militarized their own social spaces. Dovetailing with current medical and urban design thinking (e.g., miasma theory), the contrast between wealthy, spacious European enclaves and the densely-packed city centers further stoked the colonist's sense of racial superiority and paranoia. Often, newly-established rail lines acted as _de facto_ boundaries, the "civil lines" (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006, 109) between European and indigenous spaces; And within European spaces, dovetailed architectural and social practices further compartmentalized inter-racial interactions, spatially and temporally.

### Modernity

In fact, in the 19th century, rail and telegraph lines were sprouting all over the colony. Rather than "importing modernity" from Britain, India's value to the British meant technological innovations were deployed simultaneously in the two territories, with India sometimes used as a proving ground. The introduction of railways (funded by private British companies with guaranteed loans from the EIC and later the Crown) simultaneously expedited the colony's extractive economy and military relocation for expansion; While on the communication front,

> The telegraph linking the chief centres of India was completed during Dalhousie's term. Comprising some 4,500 miles of line, it made possible rapid transmission of information on politics, security, trade, and industry, as well as the personal messages of evermore individuals. The cable linking Britain and India... was laid in 1865, a year before the link between Britain and the U.S." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006, 99)

The governmental "penny post" was established in 1854, allowing mail to be sent "any distance within the country, at the same low cost," and proved "indispensable to the communications and fundraising of the voluntary societies, organizations, and publishers emerging in this period." Shipbuilding improvements in concert with the newly-opened Suez Canal further expedited information exchange: "In the 1830s an exchange of letters between Britain and India could take two years; by 1870... a letter could reach Bombay in only one month." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006, 99) Thus, Ranganathan was born to an India newly-transformed by transportation and information infrastructures.

In contrast to the EIC, the Crown's civil apparatus became increasingly occupied with information control. The first decennial Indian census was undertaken in 1872, and a full geographic survey completed in 1878. Newspapers now required government permits, and copies of books and pamphlets were required to be submitted to the government.<sup>4</sup>

Coming full-circle to this section's main heading: British enthusiasm for racial segregation, information control, and 19th c. scientific practices coalesced into an increasingly systematized and policed anthropological view of India's 200 million deeply heterogeneous residents. Traditionally nomadic "pastoral" tribes were now classified as "itinerant," and therefore "criminal." (Metcalf & Metcalf, 2006, 112) Bolstered by the ever-improving technology of photography,

> The most important identity for Victorian anthropologists of India was 'caste', taken as a concrete, measuring 'thing' that could be fitted into a hierarchy able to be ascertained and quantified in reports and surveys... The first major compilation of such photographs was _The Peoples of India_, published by the Government of India in 1868 in eight volumes. The picture of the Banjaras, for example, nomadic herdsmen and traders... was accompanied by a description of them having 'a reputation for perfect honesty', but they were later relegated to the status of 'criminal tribe', a reminder of the fantasy that passed for exactitude. <ins>The caste 'system' is thus one of the countless parameters of life in India that is a product of modern change... now too often identified as 'traditional'</ins>. \[ed: Emphasis my own.\] (ibid, 112)

For example, the 1901 decennial census attempted to "arrive at a \[hierarchical\] classification of castes in accordance with an order of precedence established on the basis of native public opinion:"

> The following criteria were considered: the varna to which the caste in question belonged; whether or not the Brahmans accepted water from it; whether it was served by Brahmans of high status, by other Brahmans, or by its own priests; whether it practised infant marriage and forbade remarriage for widows; profession; whether or not it was served by the barber and other specialists; whether or not it had access to the precincts of certain temples; whether or not it was excluded from using the communal well, was regulated to a distinct quarter, was obliged to leave the road when a superior was encountered. (Dumont, 1970)







## On Process; The Demarcation Problem; A Controlled And Focused Slipping Along The Boundary

The above (frankly, obsessive) example of hierarchical knowledge systematization demonstrates an extreme aversion to uncontrolled, happily ambiguous ways of moving through information, personal experiences, and the world generally. 

Per my recent exposure to the demarcation problem and its resistance to quantification, I've been considering the nature / character of my research process here in these early stages, where the shrub must be left to grow wildly before it's eventual topiary prune. In the context of demarcation, I will be pursuing a strategy expertly discussed and executed in Melissa McCarthy's _Sharks, Death, Surfers: An Illustrated Companion_ (2019): I will be "slipping" along "the boundary;" Practicing "_he'e nalu_ \[ed: surfing\]... a controlled and focused slipping, using 'great dexterity & address.'" (McCarthyl, 2019, 39) This research approach is

> the sort of activity that could swerve a man away from the imperial regimen of classifying, claiming territory, drawing fresh maps, and <ins>systematizing</ins> the unknown. Away from a distinct world defined by external coordinates and into a particular sort of immersion and <ins>participation</ins> in that world. \[ed: Emphasis my own.\]

> Surfing has a particular sort of freedom, the special quality of being in a privileged relationship with the boundary. The surfer is not in the water, in the air, on dry land, but a little of all of these, all at once; in a carefully controlled balance between each element. There is a useful term that we could borrow from the world of football \[ed: soccer\] the surfer is a _Raumdeuter_, or "space interpreter," who can make something from one realm comprehensible in another, who can negotiate between the two zones. The surfer understands that a boundary is not an impermeable, confining membrane, nor a simple signpost indicating a new state, but fundamentally an opportunity. It enables the surfer to slide along and enjoy the interface. (45)

This approach not only better aligns with perspective on the value of academic research as a whole, but hews well to my practical experience with entities like the Prelinger Library, who encourage a broader understanding of the knowledge space than is typical of academic institutions. But there are dangers to this approach when engaging with material outside one's own culture and experience; To continue the metaphor, patterns of swell and tide obvious to a beach's residents that can easily cause a visitor to bail.



## M.P.T. Acharya

I've been popping through a collection of essays by the Indian Anarchist M.P.T. Acharya on my BART commutes to-and-from work. Acharya and R. overlap in some surface respects: They were born just a few years apart to _brahmin_ families in the Madras states; but beyond this, I'm as yet unaware if their divergent trajectories ever crossed.

Acharya's family was influential in the opening phases of the formal Indian Nationalist movement, and he took to the written word early. His predilection for political envelop-pushing eventually necessitated a flight to continental Europe, where he linked up with various threads of the international communist and anarchist movements; The British Raj banned his increasingly radical writings in his home country from 1910 to 1935. The collection I'm reading (Laursen, 2019) spans 1923 to 1953, and the essays therein are perhaps better termed missives; They're typically a few hundred words long, and respond to current events.

Beyond opposition to hierarchical organizations, anarchists are a pretty heterogeneous bunch when it comes to theory & praxis. From the pieces I've read so far, his work is utopian rather than practical: He advocates for the abolition of money, government beyond commune-level direct democracy, the military, etc. etc. In the context of the nationalist movement, Acharya's pacifism resulted in an interesting relationship with his contemporary Mahatma Gandhi (better-known both contemporarily and historically). Sometimes effusive in praise (_Gandhi and Non-Violence_, 1930; _Nationalism in India_, 1933), Acharya also criticized Gandhi's approach to pacifism for concluding at civil disobedience rather than disavowing the violent coercion present at the root of the State.<sup>5</sup> (_Mother India_, 1928)

To put a slightly finer point on this, Acharya saw the cessation of British rule as an opportunity for social liberation; Rather than replacing one government with another, he instead advocated against the formation of a constitutional government, and devolving sovereignty directly to the people. Being still new to anarchist theory, there is a steady, illicit thrill in encountering ideas like this: Constitutions, Bills of rights, and other government-formation documents are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they draw boundaries around what the State can and cannot do; But on the other, their existence legitimizes both State control of the citizenry, _and_ a framework for expanding the circumstances and nature of this control. If a country without a constitution seems a bit too wacky, a bit too utopian, even a cursory glance through the history books reveals it's a rare day indeed when the State dissipates rather than consolidates its power -- so in another way of thinking, it's actually deeply practical to decline repeating this pattern.

A little surprisingly, recent political events in the U.S. have begun to bubble these ideas up from niche political discourse into the public sphere. The week following my detour into Acharya, NYT published a longread titled "[The Constitution is Sacred. Is It Also Dangerous?](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/books/review/constitution-secession-democracy-crisis.html)" while their characteristically histrionic op-ed department opted for the pearl-clutching "[The Constitution Is Broken and Should Not Be Reclaimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/opinion/liberals-constitution.html)" just a few days later.

0. "'Pravachanam' is a Sanskrit word which means a discourse from a Guru on any matter related to spirituality or code of conduct. In the good old days of Guru-Shishya tradition, \[ed: Teacher-student\] Gurus dedicated their lifetime propagating the principles they believed through 'Pravachanams' to the interested Shisyas in particular, and to the common public in general."

1. The East India Company's control of India (the "Company Raj") lasted from the mid-1700s until the rebellion of 1858, after which the EIC was disolved and India was govered directly by Queen Victoria (later titled "Empress of India" by Parliament in 1876). Both modern-day Pakistan and Myanmar (then Burma) were included in British India; The 1949 partition at the conclusion of British rule is its own terrible saga. ¶ British partisan Moorehouse (1983) notes the 1958 rebellion arose in a decentralized manner, with different instigating events for different demographics, and opines that "what the whole episode never remotely resembled was a national struggle for independence as some Indians in the 20<sup>th</sup> century wish to believe." One might question what other motivation the opressed might have for slaughtering their oppressors?

2. Prior to the famine, Madras was experiencing an annual population growth of about 1.2 million; Afterword, its population growth remained halted until 1881. (Butterworth, 1932)

3. For a particularly nightmarish tangent, see the execution method of 'Blowing from the Gun;' which the EIC began using as a punishment for desertion and treason following a survey of the region's common execution techniques, and was used extensively following the 1958 rebellion.

4. Side note: I'd honestly never considered the surveilance aspect of the LOC's repository function until reading this.
