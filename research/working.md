# Working - ALIS Centenary Issue: Summaries

The Annals of Library and Information Studies \[ALIS\] is the "oldest and leading" English-language LIS journal in India. It was launched in 1954 by the Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre \[INSDOC\]; which after a few mergers was renamed to National Institute of Science Communication and Information \[NISCAIR\]. Ranganathan was ALS' first editor.

This special issue celebrates the centenary of R.'s appointment to Madras University Librarain, containing "studies by LIS scholars, both from India and from abroad, that discuss various facets of Ranganathan’s thought and its enduring effect upon LIS theory and practice." The studies are divided into three categories, focusing on subjects that influenced R.'s thinking; His continuing influence in the LIS field; and considerations of "his legacy in light of the latest advances in the practice of information system design." (Bianchini & Dousa, 2024)

The following summaries are condensed from my full notes, which are available on the research page. Rather than by chronology or issue-order, they're ordered by relevancy to my line of inquiry.











## S.R. Ranganathan: Making of the man and his method (Satija & Gupta, 2024)

Along with a useful biographic sketch, this paper touches on several relevant aspects of R.'s work and philosophy for my research. Most significantly, R.'s ideas about "intellection" and "intuition;" in his view, both equally valid paths toward knowledge-gaining. The former is rational, while the later is the mystical "Eureka" moment where the knowledge appears fully-formed, independent of sensory perception and rational deduction and "transcend\[ing\] the space-time matrix." The next paper goes into more detail about R.'s view of mysticism and spiritual experience, but this paper contextualizes these ideas within _Ekavakyata_:

> The basic premise of _Ekavakyata_ is the unity of all knowledge. The systems approach is a weaker form of this principle; mysticism and intuition are its main instruments. Its core tenets are that all entities in this universe are interconnected with one another and that, therefore, one should not view individual entities in isolation.

A tangent  in this paper relating to "the very moment that our budding discipline was desginated as a science, \[and\] sceptics raised doubts about whether it indeed served such a status." Passive voice: Designated by who? Who were the skeptics? We find a tangential mention of the Chicago School's 1930 declaration; which I'll need to look into.

The upshot for me is providing a framework for describing the systems Esoteric Computing is looking to build: Our current digital library infrastructure is catering only to "intellection" -- we are neglecting to build systems catering to the equally meaningful knowledge-creation strategy of "intuition."







## Ranganathan’s Religion and Its Influence on His Library Science (Broughton, 2024)

Broughton warns us that R.'s description of his religious, philosophical, mystical, and other esoteric both evolved and occasionally self-contradicted.



### Philosophy, "Ascetism," Nationalism

"While it is agreed that Ranganathan’s religious beliefs are not apparent from his writings, his use of Indian philosophical methods is more evident." Broughton again provides some helpful compare-and-contrast with Western systems; Citing, in a broad sense, a sort of transcendence or "liberation from the world of time, change, and rebirth" as the end-goal of these philosophical pursuits.

R.'s unusually humble lifestyle occasionally "led many Indian commentators to regard him as a mystic, although that was not the case and he himself repudiated it." Other contemporaries of R., referencing referencing _bhakti_ principles, described him as a "_Karma Yogi_"; That is, one who works toward "liberation" by "yoking" himself to acts or works -- in R.'s case, his single-minded focus on Library science.

Interestingly, Yogeshwar reports R. adopted traditional Indian dress and grooming (which he maintained while in England) after atending a c. 1930 talk by Ghandi, who's push for the use of [Khadi cloth](https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/khadi-a-cloth-and-beyond.php) was an integral component of the Nationalist movement. Prior to this, and later in life, he wore Western fashions. Once again, Broughton points out Western readers often overlook that

> R. was prominent as a public intellectual figure in Indian society... and he played a role in the political, social, and educational development of the country. Foskett speaks of how his appointment as a National Research Professor by the Indian Government "acknowledged the contribution that he had made not only to librarianship, but to the life of the nation."

And that

> identification with the Indian independence movement was central to his library theory. Ranganathan’s pioneering work of the 1930s challenged the ideological structures of colonial rule, advocating libraries and librarians as agents of a national political awakening, especially amongst the rural poor.


### Astrology, Seances

Because of his analytical nature, R.'s interest in astrology (_Jyotisa_) came as somewhat of a surprise to his Western counterparts -- but the position of Astrology within the Hinduism's classical educational framework (the _Vendangas_) renders it a fairly divergent practice from its Western counterpart. R.'s first scholastic discipline, Mathematics, "in some contexts is considered a subdscipline of _jyotisa_." 

Several sources report R. regularly held seances around 1934, using a Ouigi board to contact the mathematician Ramanujan about whom R. was currently writing a monograph. R.'s son "Yogeshwar says that the group of friends and colleagues who joined his father in 'these spiritualistic or mystic escapades' were all reputable scientists, and for "all of them, there was no link between religion and mysticism."



### Class Δ

The most relevant portion of this paper deals with the Colon Classification's Main Class "Δ  Spiritual Experience and Mysticism"; which sits at the exact halfway point in the classifiction, which (broadly) represents a spectrum from hard/evidentiary sciences to social/inferrential sciences -- or put another way, from "Intellection" to "Intuition." (R.'s placement of the Philosophy and Religion main classes also notably differ from most universical classification schemes.) It's indicator, the delta symbol, is a pictograph of the triangle/pyrmid, associated with mysticism and esoterica the world over.

Class Δ was added in later editions of Colon Classifiation (I'm working from R.'s final 6th ed., 1960); and he includes significantly more opening remarks about this class than most others (typically, he'll write a paragraph or two; Δ has two full pages of text). These remarks are striking and significant, characterizing mysticism as destined to become "the keystone in the arch" of all knowledge, as the human race progresses (significantly paraphrasing here) up the intellectual equivalent of Maslow's heirarchy.

What does it mean that "The Father of Library <ins>Science</ins>" is communicating this to us so boldly, so directly? That his predictions have proven thus far somewhat premature? And that, pedagogically, we familiarize lIS students (however cursorily) with R.'s Five Laws, but not his Class Δ?













## Soul, Subtle Body, Gross Body: S.R. Ranganathan’s Ontology of the Book in (Its) Context(s) (Dousa, 2024)

Beginning around 1948 and culminating with his 1952 publication of three inter-related volumes,<sup>1</sup>Ranganathan developed an ontology of the book that presages many later bibliographic frameworks (particularly FRBR's "Work, Expression, Manifestation, Instance" model for Group 1 entities, outlined in 1998). R.'s ontology, however, was adapted from classical hindu philosophy concerning each individual's (_jīva_) Soul (_ātma_), Subtle Body (_sūkṣma-śarīra_) and Gross Body (_sthūla-śarīra_).

- The Hindu concept of _jīva_ is "Perhaps best glossed as 'the empirical self', a _jīva_ is a living individual being that stands in a firstperson ('I') relationship to the world."
- A individual carries with them a Soul, which is an exclusively metaphysical entity, existing outside physical concerns of time and space; The _ātma_ is "eternal, indestructible, and immutable, and so forms the existential and spiritual core of the _jīva_."
- The Subtle Body exists in the material world, but is made of a "finer" substance than the molecules, atoms, and quarks which form the stuff of tables, chairs, bones, flowers, (etc). The Subtle Body "encompasses the mind (_antaḥkaraṇa_), including the intellect or cognitive capacity (_buddhi_), the ability to feel a sense of individuality or ego (_ahaṁkāra_), and the faculty of processing sensory data (_manas_)."
- The Gross body is an individual's physical form.<sup>2</sup>

In the cycle of samsara, the Gross Body's physical breakdown ends one lifetime, while the Soul and Subtle Body are reincarnated. Because its domain is the mind and voluntary actions, the Subtle Body carries an individual's karma, and is responsible for its acrual and discharge between physical lifetimes.

Most often, Ranganathan presents a three-part ontology of the book, but occasionally condenses this down to two. The three-part ontology is presented as follows:

- A book's Soul is its "thought-content:" The ideas the author is working with and communicating, along with its aboutness, subject matter, the directionality of its arguments, and what we'd shorthand in 2024 to vibe.
- Its Subtle Body are the semiotics: The actual language used to translate the ideas and vibes into a work of literature; Syntax and diction; And its illustrations or figures.
- Its Gross Body is its physical form: The binding, paper weight, typesetting, font size, etc.

The two-part ontology refelcts the conjoining of the Soul and Subtle Body during samsara:

- The Soul and Subtle Body constitute a book's ideas and expression, characterized here as the "work."
- The Gross Body constitutes a book's physical form, characterized here as the "document."

In the way that the Soul and Subtle Body can cycle through a procession of gross bodies, a "work" can be transmitted into various "documents" (e.g., editions) and still retain its essential identity. This coupling of a book's ideas and their expression emphesizes that, if one wants to write a book, expressing ideas through writing is the only way to do so.<sup>3</sup> Many authors would probably argue the writing process itself is integral to the formation and refinement of a book's "thought-content." R. "underscores the unity between thought and its linguistic or pictorial expression by stating that 'the expression and thought are inseparable,' citing the opening lines of the Kalidasa’s epic poem _Raghuvamsa_."




### Why does everyone dismiss the Gross Body?

Dousa dismissively describes the Gross Body as a mere platform for the Soul and Subtle Body:

> Of the three concepts, that of the gross body, or _sthūla-śarīra_, requires no comment, for, in both models, it serves simply as the physical substrate of the entity in question: just as the gross body is the physical body of a living being like a man, horse, or mosquito, so is the gross body of a book simply the physical object containing text and illustrations.

R. likewise suggests seeking out healthy, strong, atractive bodies: Heavyweight bindings and study pages that can withstand frequent circulation, and fascinating covers that insprire "bibliophilia."

I take issue with this tendency to diminish the importance of the Gross Body; But my cricitisims here extend tangentially from the central Hindu metaphor and stem from two broad areas of my personal experience:

1. Inhabing a Gross Body with a few distinctive features that effect my "firstperson ('I') relationship to the world."
2. Working in a used book store, which made plainly obvious the differing psychological and emotional effects which arise from handling different editions of the same work.










## A Domain Analysis of the Influence of _The Five Laws of Library Science_ (Martínez-Ávila, et al.)

This is a quantitative bibliometric analysis, collecting "all works citing \[_The Five Laws of Library Science_\] in the Web of Science Core Colltion," resulting in "306 citing documents." Several rounds of disambiguation and processing resulted in "81 keywords," and six document types. 

The citing publications dated from 1957 to the present, with "an increasing trend from 2005 onward," accounting for 77.5% of total citations. (This comports with my FLFX research, most of which is found in the early web era and beyond. Also, note the citations/year graph resembles the total number of publications per year -- e.g. we might be looking at an [xkcd heatmap](https://xkcd.com/1138/).)

English-lanuage publicaitons were the large majority (272), with Portuguese being the next highest (21). Martínez-Ávila, et al. trace this line of scholarship to Hagar Espanha Gomes, who from the 1970s onward produced "studies of and about Ranganathan’s classification theory from the Graduate Program in Information Science at the Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (IBICT), the pioneer graduate course in the 'Library and Information Science' in Latin America and the Caribbean.”

Articles (206) were the most frequent, with Proceedings (26) and Others (24; including Editorial Material, Book Review, Note, and Letter) being the next highest. (Again, broadly comporting with proportions for the LIS publishing field generally.)

### Don't Make Tap The Sign (quantative research without qualitative research lacks important context about what's being measured)

Martínez-Ávila et al. note:

> The age of the work has not prevented it from being cited by recent journal articles, in which discussions about new trends and philosophical foundations for LIS are published, and this confirms that the book is a strong basis for work in the area and that is a sign of its relevance and connection to the current scientific discourse.

And I want to push back on this. <ins>My qualitative work on the FLFX corpus identifies a trend in _The Five Laws_-citing publications toward a reduction, haphazard treatment, or blatant misreading of its contents</ins>. Per my previous work on uncitedness, this once again reveals the limitations of quantitative analysis: We know _when_ a work is being cited, but not _why_, or _the nature_ of the author's engagement with the cited work. I believe personally that R.'s _Five Laws_ remains a deeply relevant work, but I'm concerned that its "connection to the current scientific discourse" requires an asterisk.

**The network graph of authors cited alongside R.** shows a quantitative representation of the lack-of-context I've been complaining about in the FLFX report. This graph includes a small cluster of co-authors representing a "thematically distant" body of work from the others:

> J. Daniel Elam writes about anticolonialism (and the fact that _the Five Laws_ were developed during colonial India is mentioned by George), while Kama Maclean and Ajay Skaria write about the history of India (both are cited by Elam). The point is that Ranganathan is cited as a historical figure in a book in which several authors are co-cited without being in direct relationship to Ranganathan’s discourse, only because they give a description and reference to _The Five Laws_.

Put another way: The majority of authors who cite Ranganathan (who are mainly from the LIS world) are <ins>unlikely to reference Indian historical or sociopolitical work in their papers</ins>.







## Lights from the Ramayana in Ranganathan’s Philosophy (Gupta & Satija, 2024)

Here we find a lengthy discussion of the Ramayana in R.'s life and work. The ancient Sanskrit epic appears frequently in R.'s writings and lecutres, and informs, at an underlying level, the ideological grounding of his knowledge classification and The Five Laws. 

One interesting quote from Kumar Girja's (1992) _Ranganathan: An Intellectual Biography_ posits that R.'s daily Ramamyana readings provided a much-needed break from his unrelenting work schedule, and that its frequent appearance in his work was perhaps from R.'s deep, repeated immersion in the book-as-literature rather than from a primarily religious standpoint. Girja posits the book held, for R., a kind of utopian ideal in its alegories and literary representation of animals, humans, gods, and inclusivity of rational and spiritual matters. 

If that's the case, what does it mean that so much of R.'s work incorporates a _work of literature_?

R. argues in his ontology that some books' souls (see next ALIS paper) are so powerful they persist immortally; We are accustomed in Academia to giving deference to ancient epics (the Odysee, etc.) -- but what if this preference simply arose from scarcity?

But what if instead we looked to our personal cannons? Is part of the immortal soul power of an epic its monocultural familiarity? And what about the breakdown of the monoculture following post-modernism? Is it "fair" to place the onus on the reader to "catch up" wi the author's cannon? We permit this patience when engaging trans-nationally, so why not locally? Perhaps this is a benefit of digestible critical forms (33 1/3, BFI, AFI, Boss Fight Books, etc.)









## Ranganathan's Documentation in Opposition to European Documentation: a Position based on Library Science (Sales & Amorim)

From the U.S. perspective, this is a storm in a teacup. In the late 1900s, Europe developed a separate field of Documentation, which in the U.S. never calved from Library Science. At the time, libraries were primarily concerned with books-qua-books; While "Documentalists" were focused on journals, ephemera, and (broadly) the dissemination of new scientific findings; The end-game Documentalists envisoned was a universal shared catalog-cum-Wikipedia. Ranganathan's argument against Documentation as a field aligns with the U.S. perspective; That is, the specialized metadata practices forwarded by Documentalists were more _adaptations_ of existing LIS practices than a totally separate field.









#### (skimmed) From Knowledge Organization to Knowledge Representation and Back (Giunchiglia, F., Bagchi, M., & Das, S.)

This fascinating but horribly-written article requires the reader to slog through a soupy marsh of technobabble and meandering syntax.

Knowledge Organization \[KO\] and Knowlege Representation \[KR\] are two different strategies for making the unweildy heap of human knowledge legible. KO is mainly used in library science, while KR is mainly used in ML and AI.

KO is divided into Systems and Approaches:
- **Systems** describes classification, catalogging, indexing, and other descriptive/documentary techniques.
- **Approaches** describes the selection and combination of systems to achieve a desired outcome.

KR is divided into Artefacts and Metholodigies:
- **Artefacts** are output like knowledge graphs, n-grams, and other machine-derived and -actionable data.
- **Methodologies** are the tooling and techniques used to produce artefacts.

Though their "high-level functionality" is comprable (e.g. Both KO and KR aim to provide a navigable map of knowledge), their differing aproaches lead to significantly different output. KO is intentional and its output arises from a cultural lineage; KR's output is emergent, and describes knowledge based on the particulars of its tooling.

Giunchiglia, et al. observe KO and KR's respective strengths and weaknesses are quite compatable: That is, KO's systems are typically lack technical emphesis, while KR's methodologies typically lack considerations of the cultural context (e.g. "cannons") in which knowledge production occurs. This paper examines the high-level correspondence betwen KO and KR outputs, and the feasibility of combining the two appraoches.








## Notes

1. _Library Book Selection_; _Social Bibliography, or Physical Bibliography for Librarians_; and _Social Education Literature for Authors, Artists, Publishers, Teachers, Librarians and Governments_.

2. The Causal Body (_kārana-śarīra_) acts as the bridge between the imaterial Soul and the material Subtle Body, but is not considered R.'s ontology.

3. To put this more generally: Communicating ideas is the only way to communicate them. Even conceptual art is typically "set down" in some capacity (e.g. Nam June Paik's fluxus scores), Even short-duration ephemeral works must be brought into existance.

## Leaves / Pressings

This has been a very busy week for me (aside from the election, which of course created its own strange weather). On Thursday, I presented with an Institutional Researcher colleguea at the 2024 California Assoc. of Institutional Researchers, where I was a total fish out of water -- AFAIK the only representative from a library system.

This was an illuminating experience -- for one, I assumed "institution research" was a lowercase phrase (e.g. I work at an institution and do research!) but as it turns out, it's a very specific job title with its own baffling universe of acronyms (IPEDS, IE, etc). Representatives were there from the UC, CSU, CCC, and a few independent universities; I also became aware of some interesting undercurrents of tension between the UC and CSU systems, regarding the former's status as an R1, and the later's frustration that the legitamately difficult work of education is undervalued as compared to research. (Both of my parents were educators in the CSU system, so I've personally seen the herculean workload involved.)

Broadly, digital librarians and IR folks share a very similar set of tools and techniques (They're all working in python, R, SQL, and tableau just like we are), but there's some important differences:
- We have more expertise in gigantic volumes of data, and the attendent nitty-gritty details like efficient SQL execution plans, transaction differences (etc).
- IR is doing significantly more qualitative research (mainly surveys, some focus groups -- they use a software package called SPSS to analyse this), and their stakeholder management is significantly more complex than ours.

All-in-all, it was a good experience, and an excellent opportunity to practice some new autism-related CBT techniques for managing adverse sensory environments.
