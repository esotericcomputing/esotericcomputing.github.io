# Working - The Five Laws, 



## Front Matter

_The Five Laws of Library Science_ (Hereafter FL.) opens with a hefy chunk of front matter, but most interesting is the five-part introduction by W. C. Berwick Sayers (Chief librarian, Croydon; Lecturer in the University of London School of Librarianship; Examiner in Library Organization to the Library Association (see Context 2: England)).

Sayers' introduction involves some occultist undercurrents -- hermeticism, specifically -- if you know where to look. In particular, it frames the Five Laws as _revealed_ rather than _constructed_ knowledge, with a lineage extending to (who else?) "the Pharaohs," whose famed papyrus catalogs are "the wonder of modern librarians who have considered them." Thus, R.'s Five Laws have "existed in embryo form in the Assyrian libraries."
