# Working - Context Part 2 : England, 1924

## Rural - Urban
The Industiral Revolution completely transformed England. In 1801, 44% of the population lived in cities; by 1911, the population had roughly quadrupled and this share was up to 89%. (Goodman, 2013, p. 200) The shift to an industrial work in densifying cities led to massive political shifts at every strata of government. 


## Science

British intellectual life underwent radical changes in the 19th c.


### Secularism

Picking up on the work of Karl von Hoff, Charles Lyell's 1830 _Principles of Geology_ argued the Earth must be much older than the biblically-stipulated 6,000 years. _Principles_ made a significant impact on Charles Darwin, who understood the ramifications of this timescale in biology; The two scientists became close friends and correspondents. Following Darwin's return from his 1831 Galapagos expedition, Lyell continually pestered him to publish his theories, as Darwin languished in depression and imposter syndrome for the next two decades. His 1858  Linean Society presentation with Russell Wallace, and 1859 publication of _On the Origin of Species_ swung wide the door Lyell had cracked open, precipetating a full reconsideration of the roles of religion and science in British culture as a whole. (Heffer, 2022)

The emergence of religious skepticism into the public sphere (like the 1860 Huxley-Wilburforce debate in Oxford), "can be seen with highindsight as the end of the medival world, whose ideas were so often rooted in blind faith, and the start of the modern, whose ideas were so often rooted in rationalism." (Heffer, 2022, p. 200) But just as it does today, a wide range existed between the poles of religion and secularity; And eventually we found ourselves, according to Himmelfarb, with the poles paradoxically reversed: "The final irony is to have the old stereotypes, of an enlightened science and a bigoted religion, replaced by new ones: A 'scientific naturalism' that was dogmatic, narrow-minuted jealous of its newly-aquired authority, lacking social vision and emotional depth; and a 'spiritualism' that was imaginative, open-minded, compassionate, receptive to new forms of consciousness and speculation." (Heffer, 2022, p. 227)




### Education

In the first half of the 19th c. British primary education was in a bad state.<note>Scottland</note> In 1855, one MP estimated that only one in eight children attended school. No standards existed curicula, teachers, or administrators; An 1851 survey of school headmasters found them a motley crew of mostly down-on-their-luck tradesmen getting by while they gameplanned the next step. Factories employing children were required to have schools; The level of instruction here was aggressively remedial. (Heffer, 2022, 419-421)

<note>Scottland</note> Interestingly, this state of affairs applied mainly to England and Wales; Scottland had actually gotten its act together on Education back in the 17th c., with a robust system of public education from primary school through college. (Heffer, 2022, 413)

There was scarecly any national education policy or oversight; And with the exception of reformatory and workhouse schools, each school was a privately-run endeavor. Educational reformers in Parliament had been raising alarm at the state of affairs for several years, but the momentum to act failed to materialize until the passage of the 1867 Reform Act, which over the next two years, would extend sufferage to all male heads of households.

Such a shift, insisted MP Robert Lowe, meant that public education had "become paramout to every other questions that has been brought before us. From the moment that you entrust the masses with power their education becomes an absolute neccesity." (Heffer, 2022, p. 413) Thus began a suite of legilsation enabling a nationalized school systems. A few key passages were the 1870 Education Act, which created school boards; the 1881 Mundella's Act which made attendance compulsory for children aged 5 to 10; And the 1891 Fee Grant Act, which made this education free. (Heffer, 2022, p. 415-416)

<note>Lowe is a complex character, now often reviled for his pedagogical insistance on "The Three Rs" at the expense of broader perspectives, and his almost parodically severe resentment of the lower classes.</note>

The state of British higher education in the early 1800s was similarly bleak: English colleges focused almost exclusively on classics; Teachers were underpaid and often nepotistically-appointed; And there was little in the way of academic standards. At Eaton, a student's prestige was gained or lost on the cricket field or rowing circuit rather than in the classroom. (Heffer, 2022, p. 451) "An Oxford examiner testified" that of the 168 candidates who took the Univeristy Examinations, 47 failed, and 43 of those "'failed so universally as to show that they were "utterly unfit to to undergo any examination whatsoever."'" (Heffer, 2022, p. 450)

In 1861, Parliament began an inquirry, headed by Lord Clarendon, into the state of England's nine leading universities, "Eaton, Harrow, Charterhouse, Wstminster, St Paul's Whichester, Rugby, Shrewsbury, and Merchant Taylors." (Heffer, 2022, p. 446) The commission's daming 1864 report led to several curiccula reforms madates, and culminated in the 1868 Public Schools Act, wich took the nine universities "out of the hands of either the government of the Church and made the independent." (Heffer, 2022, p. 416) (Note: This is the linguistic origin of why public universities in England are viewed as more prestigious than private ones.) In the lead-up to the 1868 act, Clarendon and his supporter Prince Albert needed to make the case that State control of education was neither overreach or "akin to pauperism." (Heffer, 2022, p. 467) 

Thereafter, collegiate administrative duties were increasingly divorced from (mainly Anglican) religious orders, expediting a slow shift towards rationalist pedagogy that had been slowly underweigh since the late 1840s. (Heffer, 2022. p. 446) Unviersities began offering modern langagues like French and German, and introduced science and math courses. As Oxford don Goldwin Smith later reflected, with these changes, "Liberalism soon took the practical shape of an effort to reform and emancipate the university, to strike off the fetters of medieval statues from it and from its Colleges, set it from the predominance of ecclesiasticism, recall it to its propper work, and restore it to the nation" (Heffer, 2022, p. 448)

### Libraries

Prior to the mid-1800s, the expense of printed material meant library subscription fees were feasible only for the wealthy. But with the dropping price of print, by the midcentury, a proliferation of smaller libraries, often associated with "various institutions of rational recreation"  like "the Mechanics Institute... temprance socities, trade unions clubrooms, the various literary and scientific socities, \[and\] several of the larger cotton mills" were accessible for the working class. (Hewitt, 2000, p. 65) Not only for educational purposes, these spaces often functioned for political organization, notably for the Chartism movement beginning in the late 1830s (a radical working class movement demanding male sufferage and other democtratic reforms). 



Parliamentary concern about the state of the lower classes led to a series of commissions through the mid 1830s dealing, broadly, with how to discourage drinking and encourage "healthier" pursuits like physical fitness and education.

In typical Victorian


During the early 19th c., "the most powerful forces tending to promote free and public libraries... originated in the developing pressures experienced in growing urban communities" (Fletcher, ref. Jones)

During the 1830s, Parliament formed a series of Select Committees to investigate strategies for uplifting the lower classes, focusing mainly on combating the scourge of drink, and providing public venues for cultural edification. Though the reccomendations therefrom "produced few tangible results, one recurring theme emerged in the investigations—a belief in the maniforld virtues of education." (Fletcher, 1996) And the library legislation we'll cover shortly was explictly linked with schools; The approval of Library funding was contingent on nearby (or new) schools providing practical classes using the library's materials.

William Ewart headed the 1849 Select Committee on Libraries, and used his earlier (successful) 1845 Museums Act as a stepping stone for the Lublic Libraries and Museums Act of 1850. This first act was focused primarily on land acquisition; Two additional Public Library Acts in 1855 and 1866 rounded out the resources needed to fully implement a national library system. (Fletcher, 1996) <note>Hilariously, the 1850 Act didn't provide funding to purchase books.</note> And though the rhetoric around uplifting the poor and working classes proved historically stickier, Libraries could also serve as a venue for civic pride and beautification for the upper classes; Particularly in well-to-do outlying cities, who industrialization had bolstered already established economies. (Fletcher, 1996) 

The Manchester Free Library, the first library founded under the Act in 1852, was thoroughly covered in the press, and maintains a bountiful archive of its founding materials. (Hewitt, 2000) Manchester had earned the nickname "shock city" for its rappid industrialization, and was the center of England's burgeoning cotton industry. Its deep-pocketed upper class heavily subsidized the library's construction and collection; and the library was immediately and continually used by the city's working class. (Hewitt, 2000)

Sequentially, these 1850, 1855 and 1866 Acts loosened requirements to apply for State library funds: In a city's population, from 10,000 residents, to 5,000, to no requirements at all; And for local measure passage, from a two-thirds to a simple majority. Even so, these proposals weren't always a shoe-in: Sufferage at this point was still only for landholding men, whose incentives didn't always align with the conceptual aim of the library program. (Fletcher, 1996) But, as Fletcher warns, "for much of the ninteenth century central government was not the focal point of educational activity." These government actions were merely one of many education-promoting and -providing efforts being explored in, e.g., "Anglican and Voluntary groups;" and the significant historiographic focus on legislation is perhaps due to a backwards projection of present-day educational frameworks. (Fletcher, 1996)




In the U.S., for a brief period following the establishment and rapid success of the postal service, the phrase "postalization" was used as a phrase for the process of bringing various privately- or voluntarily-held civic functions into the government. (TK cite)

### Science

During the 19th c., the practice and institutionalization of science underwent serious shifts; The term "scientist" itself was coined by William Hewell in 1834, in a complaint that fields were becoming too specialized.

But these clarifications were often pursued in line with political ideology

But the act of investigating these uncharted 




And particularly in the beginning of the 19th c., the membrane between science and esoterica was still permeable. But the selection of which theories to pursue came with its own considerations: "animal magnetism was one of several sciences of life that became political game pieces in the ideological battle between different medical constituencies. The best known example is the field of comparative anatomy in which rival developmental theories were champion at UCL and king's." (Winter, YYYY, p. 47)




So many new scientific frontiers were being broached, but the 

But the selection of which of these uncharted territories to explore was often itself guided by politics, with pet theories becoming "political game pieces in the ideological battle between different medical constituencies."

Fueled by the 1840 Penny Post, decreasing printing costs leading to swells of new publications, and the abolution of stamp duty for Newspapers, literacy was already on the rise. The midcentury saw a flurry of new libraries open, including ____ TK TK free libraries.

"By mid century there was an increasing acceptance of the need to provide cultural facilities in order to combat the ignorance of the urban workers..." (Fletcher)





1849 Select committee on Public Libraries 












(Heffer, 2022, p. 415)

"Mundella's Act of 1881 compelled attendence for children aged between five and 10 and forced payment of 3d a week." and "The Fee Grant act of 1891, passed by a conservative government under Lord Salisbury, finanly made education for children free of charge."


Such a move, Parliament thought, was a pressing reason to ensure the public was informed enough to make wise democratic decisions; Thus began a suite of educational reforms 











Peatling (2004) argues that Libraries were instrumental in the formation and consolidation of an English national identity. <note>Peatling's work is a vociferous argument for the integration of more identity politics into library history; Two decades later, most of what she's arguing for seems common practice.</note> Libraries play an essential "role in popularizing images of the world onto which constructions of nations, often established nations, are hardcoded... even by ostensibly non-political arefacts such as maps and landscapes." (p. 36) A library's classification system creating or reinforcing boundaries; Not only in fields of study (e.g., mathematics, music, spelunking), but in the idea of nationalities. For example, in 19th c. England, presenting the public with section of books from The British Empire presents a specific view of the world; A more modern example may be surveying where books about the Crimea are shelved in Russian and Ukrainian libraries, or books about Taiwain in China. 

Peatling's work is somewhat dated; In the intervening two decades, the type of identity politics and intersectional theories of power she's advocating for have become commonplace in cultural research. Her discussion of then-current work into how "contradictory discourses can emanate even from national museums" seems to be table-stakes now for currators responsible for creating museum exhibit's explanitory text.


(move up to description of library structure)
"The structure of libraries and library management often reflected religious affiliations, with local churches, bishops and clergy often represented on library committees" during the formative period of 1850-1919. (Peating, 2004)

Rejecting "primordialist" interpretations, Peatling instead argues Libraries forwarded a British identity along "modernist" lines.

Peatling suggests the following five lines of inquiry for future researchers looking to examine a library's roles in the formation of a national identity: (blockquote these:)
1. Library law and propogation of libraries by the state of local élites,
2. Particular discursive constructions of nations articulated by library administrators and commentators
3. Censorship and stock control
4. Targeted indoctrination of particular sets of readers,
5. And architecture, display and commemoriation in libraries.

Peatling (2004) mentions the "fear of political decline" in the interwar years.

Intercene divisions over the historiographic examination of the UK as a whole or the "four nations" model.




### Propaganda by the Deed


### Anarchism

Anarchism: From Peatling's (2004) perspective, national identity is a zero-sum game; These habbits, presentations, and concepts "occupy space which might have been filled by altnerative formations" creating "images of 'community' and of 'us' and 'them', \[thus affecting\] individual and collective thought and action in a way which must be regarded as political." (p. 36) But _must it_? Could it not be regarded as artistic? Spritual? Esoteric? Cooperative? The rhetoric of "'us' and 'them," thus invoked, Peatling seems to place them naturally at odds.

"The naturalization of the nation that takes place in a variety of activities is at once performative and political, occluding other ways of viewing the world with are intrinsically equally valid" (Peatling, 2004)

- Peatling rejects the "perennialist" or "primordialst" theory, that considers the formation of national identity to predate any formal State-making. 
- Ethnosymbolism: "What gives nationalism its power are the myths, memories, traditions, and symbols of ethnic heritages and the ways in which a _popular living_ past has been, and can be, rediscovered and reinterpreted by modern nationalist intelligentsias."
- "Modernist" : National identities can be explicitly constructed; e.g. State-theorized depictions of Soviet identity following the Russian Revolution. "Nations are thus seen to be 'constructed essentially from above'." (Peatling, 2004, p. 37)



As (TK TK ) argues, Ranganathan saw the Indian library movement in much the same light.

## Layers

The Vicotirans were a people of layers -- but I actually _don't mean this metaphorically_: They were stacked with cotton, flannel, silk, and wool; Combinations, crinolines, corsets, drawers, chemises, petticoats, vests, bonnets, bodices, etc. etc. etc.

In inhabiting the changing dress and living patterns of various 19th c. decades, Gonzo Historian Ruth Goodman notes how clothing alters one's motion through space and performance of various tasks. Edging a field with a sickle, for example, involves different postures and muscle groups in 1870s and modern dress: An 1870s corset encourages an upright position, where the boning and midsection reinforcement counterballances the motion of the tool; Whereas modern dress encourages a stooped position with more lateral motion. (Goodman, 2013, p. 92) Simply sitting down requires adjustment when wearing a crinolette or bustle:

> Anything that stuck out predominantly at the back required a diagonal approach to chairs. Images of the fashionable lady of the 1870s show that she perched on the very front of the chair at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees, leaning slightly forward. It is a very elegant look, but also an eminently sensible one (Goodman. 2013, p. 76)

The increased volume of skirts following the 1856 introduction of Crinolines induced a shifting of home decor to higher places to avoid any accidental knocking-over; While the reactionarily-narrow skirts of the 1885 required a new approach to walking: 

> The trick, I have found, is to adopt a slightly circular gait. At each step, it pays to move the foot outwards, describing a semicircle, rather than just stepping forwards. This ensures that the fabric has no chance to form any folds or tucks that further constrict movement, keeping it at all times taught. (Goodman. 2013, p. 77)
