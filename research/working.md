### The Similarities

Everyone seems to agree the term "book" can be happily replaced with other "aetheric" and "gross" forms of "soul content" -- e.g. "document," "digital object," etc -- but their common replacement for "reader," "user," is less linguistically and metaphorically secure. A "reader" is assumed to be interacting with a "book" in a broad engagement; That is, the reader may not have found anything of value during their read; none-the-less, the engagement itself in the form of reading is of primary concern. But what might it mean if a patron "uses" a digital photograph in a repository? How does "using" a photo differ from "viewing" a photo? How might we characterize a patron who "views" a digital magazine but does not "use" any material they found within? This is perhaps splitting hairs, but this is an academic paper; hair-splitting is the coin of the realm. Why have so many authors gravitated toward the term "use" of (e.g.) digestion, engagement, or access?

The fact is, everyone is playing fast-and-loose with what the laws mean. Frequently, people ascribe aspects of different laws to one another (e.g., Opara describes both library promotion and cataloging as part of the Second law, where R. places these specifically in the Third, and Third and Fourth, respectively.) Frankly, this makes me wonder how many people who publish papers on the Five Laws actually read the book, as opposed to reading digests or synopses from later authors?



I'm unsure how to articulate this; but there's an uncomfortable feedback loop; a pale ghost of Colonialism; some circular drawing of information, an Indian in England, then the West drawing his insights, his knowledge work, into new forms.




The more recent of these articles often include a paragraph listing all the far-flung subjects to which the Five Laws have been applied; Here, dear reader, we imagine ourselves staring into the yawning orobusian nightmare of academia; Ideas trapped forever in Saṃsāra; Analyses of analyses of analyses. I will circumvent this genre trope by instead abusing APA7's in-text citation rules.













### Five laws of the web (2004, Noruzi)

"If information is the currency of the knowledge-based economy, the Web will be the bank where it is invested."

characterizes web users as cybercitizens!

"He developed what has been widely accepted as the definitive statement of ideal library service. His Five Laws of Library Science (1931) is a classic of library science literature, as fresh today as it was in 1931."

For Ranganathan and his followers, the five laws were a first step toward putting library work on a scientific basis, providing general principles from which all library practices could be deduced (Garfield, 1984). 

Lots of good references in this one!!!

"Since 1992, the 100th anniversary of Ranganathan's birth, several modern scholars of library science have attempted to update his five laws, or they reworded them for other purposes."

""Five new laws of librarianship" by Michael Gorman (1995); "Principles of distance education" by Sanjaya Mishra (1998); "Five laws of the software library" by Mentor Cana (2003); "Five laws of children's librarianship" by Virginia A. Walter (2004); "Five laws of web connectivity" by Lennart Björneborn (2004); and "Five laws of diversity/affirmative action" by Tracie D. Hall (2004)."

"Like most laws, they look simple until you think about them." -- And therin lies the rub. R. spent 400 pages laying out exactly what he meant; trying to do this is a 2,000-word piece just ain't gonna cut the mustard.


"This law is very important because information serves no purpose if it is not utilized and at least available for people to attempt to learn. The role of the Web is to serve the individual, community and service, and to maximize social utility in the communication process." 

This is a deeply naive view of the web lol.













### The Five Laws of OER: Observations from Ranganathan (Andersen, et al., 2019)

> “Every book its reader.” This law suggests that each item in a library has an individual or individuals who would find that item useful.

No, this law suggests that librarians should create a practice of exposing the contents of their library to the fullest degree.

> “The library is a growing organism.” This law implies that libraries, as institutions, are continually changing and that library materials, methods, and facilities should be updated over time.

What is not mentioned here is that the assumed "change" is actually growth-qua-growth.

I had some nitpicks with how this paper translated the Laws for OER, but it's clear in their 2nd law treatment that they actually read the book. Here they advocate for structural changes (e.g., Libraries pushing back against longstanding policies that textbooks should be the financial purview of individual students, and using their collections budget to purchase copies for library use), and directly address the policy-based instabilities of the 2nd law's implementation:

> “If librarians are committed to “every student their educational resource,” they will need to find ways to support faculty and instructors as they negotiate new processes and potentially establish collaborative relationships with other campus entities, such as centers for teaching and learning.” (Anderson et al., 2019, p. 7)

Their reading of the 3rd law is a little far-out for my tastes:
> “every book its reader,” focuses on the intersection of discoverability, equitable access, and the variety of information formats. Ranganathan concentrated this law on the physical object of the book, intending for library materials to be relevant to all members of a community. In many ways, this is the idea that patrons can see themselves within a library’s collection. By seeing herself within a library’s collection, a patron can find an item of interest, no matter how esoteric.

As is typically, they use this law to lean toward format-agnosticism.

However, they also use it advocate for Open Access, which is a little odd if you ask me.

Also mentions collaboration with other entities creating OER content; ie political involvement.

Interestingly, the authors identify the 4th law as a major failing in the OER space:

> When Ranganathan (1931) wrote his fourth law, his focus was on open access stacks versus closed stacks; he posited that letting people find their own books saves the time of library staff, as well as patrons. This is almost the exact opposite of open access today, where an overabundance of OER can be overwhelming and difficult for faculty members to navigate. The uncurated and unedited expanse of the Internet is very different from the neatly organized stacks of a library, making it difficult to find the best educational resource for a class.

An interesting observation that the non-physical nature of OER de-incentivizes the weeding process; ergo portals can become littered with dead links.














### Re-Looking at S. R. Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Science (George, 2022)

This article has some flaws, foremost among them a reductive and IMO somewhat incorrect reading of the Five Laws. <note>(He characterizes Second Law “Every reader their books” as “every user should be able to find the materials they need and the library should be organized in a way that makes this possible,” which is more the domain of the Fourth; and the characterizes the Third Law “Every book its reader” as its end goal rather than a mode of administration which creates this environment (e.g. cataloging practices, wayfinding, etc. He characterizes The Fifth Law “Growing Organism” as “the library should always be improving and evolving to meet the needs of its users,” when in the text, this law is related to _de facto_ growth of the library system.</note> <note>The somewhat clunky sentence “Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Science were written in the 1930s when colonialism and the Second World War were still active, and merely existing was still a goal.” ([George, 2022, p. 157](zotero://select/library/items/RTYWVIMJ)) is notable for (1) using the Fifteen Years’ War Historiographic framing, and (2) being simultaneously kind of dumb and profoundly accurate.</note> In rethinking the Five Laws for "generation z," they adopt this framework:

1. **Put Content First, Not the Container.** Information now arrives in multiple formats; ergo the mode of search and discovery should focus on the information content (e.g. the book's "soul content" in R.'s esoteric framework). This is a practical suggestion, but George's statements about the universal availability of digitized content and the lack of user preference about the work's "aetheric" and "gross body" (ibid) are flat wrong.

2. **& 3. User Participation.** This grouping of the 2nd and 3rd Law is predicated on the common individualistic misreading of the 2nd Law mentioned in my last report. Here, George recommends running a 4-part study to assess:
   - What "information retrieval system" is appropriate for the user base;
   - The users' perception of the system's output given their expectations;
   - How the users are engaging with the system;
   - And Librarians dogfooding the system to understand its limitations.

4. **Information Quantitative Analysis.** "A quantifiable evaluation is crucial in the digital age since Generation Z tends to think all the time logically." \[Citation Needed\] Basically George is advocating for "data-driven" analysis techniques.

5. **The Common Learning (Online and Offline).** In considering what element of the library system is currently "growing," George recommends leaning into the freeformspaces libraries provide for collaborative user interaction.

Additionally, George's take on the Fourth Law ("Save the time of the reader") clarifies something that's been bothering me. Consider the following: “But this guideline makes it very clear: We have a responsibility to respect the time of our users since it is valuable.” (George, 2022, p. 157) In _The Five Laws_, R. invokes the bromide "Time is Money"; to which O'Dell rightly asks, "Whose Time? Whose Money?" This "Fungible Time" framework assumes a library's end-goal is the minimization or elimination of temporal interface between the "user" and "information."








### The Library is a Growing Organism: Ranganathan's Fifth Law of Library Science and the Academic Library in the Digital Era (Barner, 2011)

Barner's article arrives at the early years of Web 2.0, where users are beginning to prefer Google, Yahoo (lol), and other online sources from the "bus" or the "coffee shop," over the traditional references services provided by academic libraries. The "proper term" for this being "disintermediation" (Housewright, 2009; Lukasiewicz, 2007),<note>I love the term "disintermediation" because it encourages the metaphor of the library as a "medium" through which the dead communicate with the living, which is something I hope to explore further.</note> fueled "to a certain degree by the growing distance between the librarians, and their clients. Limits of time and budget are certainly an obstacle in the process of creating closer bonds, but the obstacle here might be more related to the human tendency to cling to what is known and familiar." (in this case, googling.) R.'s Five Laws are listed without context or elucidation; Barner connects R.'s Fifth Law metaphor with Darwin's theory of Evolution, which is discussed is more detail.

> According to Darwin, evolution has no plan or purpose. Primary differences between organisms are accidental, and those who happen to be more adapted to their environment, survive and expand. However, sometimes the environment changes at a quicker pace than the living organism can adapt itself. In those cases the organism becomes extinct. If the library is the organism as Ranganathan put it, it should be careful, for if it does not change fast enough, it will become extinct. (Barner, 2011)

Barner see R's Fifth Law as an opportunity for "the library to not only reclaim the role of mediation, but also to expand its boundaries and define new goals and roles" which will allow libraries to "<ins>survive the war of existence.</ins>" (Emphasis mine.) Barners sees heterogeneity in library structures is an asset; signaling successful adaption to a variety of environments. Barner contrasts Darwin's ex-post-facto organism environmental adaptations with R.'s ideal of farsighted adaptation; and suggests that an ideal library survival strategy "seems to be an optimal coping with disintermediation in information consumption." This can occur in two strategies: (1) Adapting existing library strategies to new digital environments, and (2) "an inventive process," which is this paper's focus. 

Barner identifies post-internet, keyword-based user search behavior (googly, skimmy, lazy) as having obfuscated and devalued the reference librarian's finely-honed searching skills, and suggest using social media as a space for advertising these skills and fielding ad-hoc reference queries. They discuss librarian's metadata-creation expertise as essential for mass digitization projects, discussing how the library can leverage online search engines SEO to better surface collections. And they discuss online publishing as an opportunity for Libraries to engage with the publishing ecosystem for the "creation of knowledge". (To this last point; CDL's strategy has been to provide a platform for academic publishing rather than the creation of a periodical. It remains somewhat unclear if this strategy is appropriate for creating visibility in the 2020s, given the rising total number of publications and decreasing engagement.)

Throughout this article, Barner casts library patrons as "consumers" or "users" of information. They recommend strategies for assisting users, both reactive (directly assisting patrons with forming a coherent search strategy) and proactive (data-driven decision-making on which information resources to surface or acquisitively bolster). These services are critical for "re-acquaint\[ing\]" users with library services:

> Discarding the library as mediator takes place to a great extent in a way similar to the changing forces in the free market. Information sources, information distribution and information services are no longer the sole province of the academic library and so the consumers turn to whoever they believe satisfies their needs in the best way (Lewis, 2009). The internet has created a space in which new bodies contend over the role of mediating information for the consumers[iv]. It is important to evoke realization and understanding of the need for assistance by information personnel among the communities of academic consumers, so they will reach the conclusion that librarian mediation and/or imparting of information literacy by the library is the best answer for them (Nicholas and Herman, 2009).

I found this a particularly fascinating, because it explicitly links the absorption of the library into an (ideologically foreign) free-market ecosystem as a bellweather of trouble. In essence, the collectivist political positions R. forwards in _Five Laws_ are specifically designed to circumvent the profit-driven necessities of the private sector to deliver information services, which in the Indian context, the private sector had failed to deliver to "every reader."












### Five New Laws of Library Science (Gorman, 1995)

(Michael Gorman was a coeditor of the AACR2) Rather than a simple noun-swap from "book" to "digital object," Gorman instead provides five new Laws stemming from Ranganathan's general ethos -- a practice I wish more of these articles embraced! The central concern here is the effects of technology on libraries, with Gorman advocating for judicious integration of new forms rather than wholesale replacement of older ones. 

1. **Libraries serve humanity**: Focuses on the broad service ethic of librarianship, e.g., the nitty-gritty particulars of our cataloging exist to help us better serve the public. Gorman suggests we ask "How will this change make the service that this library gives better?" when brainstorming changes.

2. **Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated**: "Each new means of communication enhances and supplements the strengths of all previous means."

3. **Use technology intelligently to enhance service**: "One does not have to choose between being a Luddite or a soulless technocrat." Similar to the above, Gorman advocates assessing the strengths and weakness of new technologies, and playing to their strengths; while at the same time retaining older techniques when they truly are better for the patron.

4. **Protect Free Access to Knowledge**: Here, Gorman is referring specifically to "intellectual freedom" as uncoupled from (e.g.) the closing of knowledge from capitalist practices.

5. **Honor the past and create the future**: This Law advocates for a view of the path that neither valorizes nor discards; but rather integrates into the flow of human progress.

The closing of the fifth law includes some deeply practical ideas that, none the less, rubbed me the wrong way:

> With a sense of history and a knowledge of enduring values and the continuity of our mission, the library can never be destroyed. Along with this sense of time future being contained in the time past there must be the acceptance of the challenge of innovation. It is neither the easiest of prescriptions nor the most fashionable, but libraries need to combine the past and the future in a rational, clear-headed, unsentimental manner.

But need we? _Must_ our technological  integrations be rational? Clear-headed? Unsentimental? This hews too closely to the elevation of masculinized labor at the expense of the equally valid and challenging realm of ambiguity, sentimentality, and intuition.










### Five laws of library science in MOOCs environment (Kaushik, 2021)

Describes the Five Laws as "the most established fundamental laws in the library and information science domain and are pivotal in developing value-added services and providing these services to users in the most effective manner." 

TK TK look these up:

> Even today, these five laws can also be used in different contexts and redefine library research and services (McMenemy, 2007). Sen (2008) performed a study that revealed that these five laws can also be used in diverse context and formats and similarlybyothers(Gupta, 2010; Noruzi, 2004; Chudasma, 2019; Anderson et al., 2019) including the marketing of library services, Web, cloud computing and open educational resources.

Kaushik performs a simple noun swap for their laws:

1. MOOCs are for user
2. Every learner his/her MOOC
3. Every MOOC its learner
4. Save the time of the learner
5. MOOC is a growing organism

Getting into the weeds on MOOCs isn't really my cup of tea, but this FLFX is a great demonstration of how modern authors casually denude the Second law of its political content. Here, Kaushik focuses exclusively on (e.g.) assesing which MOOCs are appropriate for various learners, missing the opportunity for deeper engagement with questions like "What if we created a subdivision of the Dept. of Education specifically to generate MOOC content, using taxpayer funding and providing the content for free?"











### S R Ranganathan’s Five Laws in the Context of Digital Libraries (Kumbhar, n.d.)

This student paper translates R.'s Five Laws for digital library contexts, substituting the term "book" for "digital object" and "reader" for "user;" The titles of the Laws are otherwise unchanged. It's not a particularly involved paper.

Discussing the First Law, Kumbhar states "information serves no purpose if it is not utilized and at least available for people to attempt to learn;" once again placing information at the primacy of the library experience -- but paradoxically, also a "Digital Library exists for society and it should serve the interest of society." But what if these interests are non-informational?





### Relevance of Ranganathan's Laws of Library Science in Library Marketing (Bhatt, 2011)

This brief article examines the Five Laws from the perspective of 21st c. library marketing. Interestingly, aside from the updated communication mediums (e.g. email, bulletin boards, "e-commerce"), nearly all of Bhatt's suggestions are at least mentioned in the text of _The Five Laws_, broadly-construed. This article's main ideological thrust is something akin to "meeting the people where they are."

Here, readers are, by necessity, translated into "consumers" during the interpretation of _The Five Laws_ in the context of marketing literature; This is, at times, uncomfortable conceptual fit, particularly considering the lengths to which R. goes in the Second Law to position library services in the realm of a public good, ergo existing outside the consumption-based framework of commercial services.

One interesting takeaway from this article concerns the concept of "atmospherics," a term "coined by Philip Kotler (1975) who defines \[it\] as 'the designing of buying and consuming environments in a manner calculated to produce specific cognitive and/or emotional effects on the target market.'' In other words, the working environment, library ambience, appearance of employees, the physical setting, lighting, work environment, noise levels, etc."






### Ranganathan Reformatted (Valentine, 2010)

Covers the "format wars" (print vs. digital) happening at the time. 

1. **Items are for use**: A narrow-interest facsimile reproduction of a medieval pslater may run into the hundreds of dollars per copy; but a scanned PDF is free. These differing formats ensure the item is accessible even if one format is out of a library's price range.
2. **Every user their format**: Some readers may prefer an electronic version of a text even if a hard copy is available (the article doesn't mention this, but accessibility is the best use case for this argument.)
3. **Every format its user**: This point makes the case for print as the ideal format for preservation.
4. **Save the time of the user**: Discusses patrons' difficulty navigating unfamiliar interfaces; and as a librarian, knowing which format is best for the patron.
5. **The library is always evolving.**: Does what it says on the tin.



### Empowering library users through the Five Laws of Library Science (Opara, 2017)

In discussing the effect of libraries, Opara gamely opens in the pre-literate era, arguing that all knowledge was personal, and citing Musingafi and Chiwanza's (2012) work on the effects of writing on knowledge capture and transmission. Thence we run through "The libraries of Ashurbanipal of Ninevah in ancient Mesopotamia, the Alexandria library by the Ptolemies, the Pergamum library by Attalus I and Eumenes II in Asia Minor, the Monastic libraries, etc." straight through to the modern era.

There's an interesting comment about the role of libraries following the Russian Revolution; Lennin was married to a librarian, and promoted libraries as equally important to education from a state-priority standpoint. Opara continues the conversation to the context of their country, Nigeria, and describes the importance of libraries not only in national development, but "in bringing about societal progress by providing resources which enrich the user's mental vision and dignifies his habit, character, taste, attitude, conduct and perception of life." The library is "a change agent \[serving\] to form the individual into a responsible citizen."<note>The unasked question here (tying back to our previous research) is what material is provided to spur this transition, who provides the material, and what perspective of a "responsible citizen" is being espoused from that perspective?</note>

> According to Garfield (1984), the five laws of library science were a first step toward putting library work on a scientific basis, providing general principles from which all library practices could be deduced. In view of the importance of these laws, Noruzi (2004) and Simpson (2008) have recommended the application of these laws to the Web and the Media respectively. Although Ranganathan later revised the laws (Dasgupta, 2007) by replacing ‘book’ with ‘document’ in the first three laws, the original form of the laws is preferred because book is a more generic term than document.

"Implicit in the second law is that the library is user-centric." Is it tho? Opara suggests users studies will identify the users for whom appropriate books are suited.
