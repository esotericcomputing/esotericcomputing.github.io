## On Hierarchy

I'm working to better understand the context in which Ranganathan (hereafter, R.) was raised, because I find it fascinating that Colon Classification -- a pure faceted system -- arose from someone near the top of a traditionally hierarchical social milleiu. One might expect someone coming from this background to design a system reinforcing rather than dissipating the hierarchical structure of knowledge. 

Trautmann (2011) provides some helpful clarification for Westerners: What we typically think of as "caste" is more properly "_varna_." The Vedic tradition (the classical system of Hindu knowledge and philosophy) divides people into four _varnas_, which specify an individual's _dharma_ (Reductively: One's duty in life). The _Rig Veda_ (c. 1500-1000 bce) includes a creation story in which "the primordial being, Purusha (man or spirit), often also called Prajapti, lord of creatures, or Brahma" completes a complex act of self-sacrifice, in which 

> ...parts of his dismembered body became the things of the phenomenal universe (animals, plants, the division of time, and so forth) including human society in its four parts: From his mouth can the brahmin, who is associated with the sacred utterance of the Veda; from his arms, the kshatriya or warrior; from his thighs, the vaishya farmer and tradesman; and from his feet the shudra or servant. (96)

Parallel to this esoteric system, we have the boots-on-the-ground system of _jatis_ which are more akin to clans in the Western context: Extended family groups typically associated with a particular region and occupation, with complex social norms governing inter-jati marriages and economic relations. And finally, we have the _castes_ proper, which "number in the thousands and they are generally limited in their extent to a single region of India." Caste provided yet another layer of social and economic norms, which often entrapped lower-caste individuals in disadvantageous circumstances. Caste discrimination was officially outlawed with "[the constitutions adopted by India in 1949 and by Pakistan in 1953](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dalit)", but still remains a relevant social grouping. Legal repairative frameworks (similar to Affirmative Action) exist for "scheduled castes;" And in India's democracy, castes often function as political interest groups whose influence politicians and governments must be cognizant of.

But, of course, this is only the internal layer of the heirarchy: There is also the British Raj (1858-1947) to contend with.<sup>1</sup> R. was born in 1892, in present-day [Sirkazhi / Siyali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkazhi), [Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanjavur,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@10.0078203,77.8920773,7.04z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3baab89cea453039:0xe113da9b1f632be6!8m2!3d10.7869994!4d79.1378274!16zL20vMDFfemtt?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), then located in the Raj's [Madras Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency). Butterworth (1932) notes, "The storm of the \[1958\] mutiny raised only a couple of ripples in Madras. ...The transfer of the government of India to the crown caused no stir whatever. The local annals are silent on the subject becuse methods and principles remained unchaged." (267) However, Madras was hit particularly hard by the 1876-7 famine, including about a third of the fallowed land and some four million deaths.<sup>2</sup>



## Notes

1. The East India Company's control of India (the "Company Raj") lasted from the mid-1700s until the rebellion of 1858, after which the EIC was disolved and India was govered directly by Queen Victoria (titled "Empress of India" by Parliament in 1876). Both modern-day Pakistan and Myanmar (then Burma) were included in British India; The 1949 partition is its own terrible story.<br><br>British partisan Moorehouse (1983) notes the 1958 rebellion arose somewhat independently among several different demographic groups from different instigating events; and opines "what the whole episode never remotely resembled was a national struggle for independence as some Indians in the 20<sup>th</sup> century wish to believe." One might question what other motivation the opressed might have for slaughtering their opressors?

2. Prior to the famine, Madras was experiencing an annual population growth of about 1.2 million; Afterword, its population growth remained halted until 1881.



## Leaves / Pressings

- "Katarzyna Niewiadoma, looking resplendent in yellow"

- SFPL used to have a page where they talked about not complying with some material in the Patriot Act which involved FBI requests for patron records. This was way back in the early 2000s and it's not there any more.

- Serious Person / Unserious Persion is a false dichotomy: A perons's seriousness is temporal, relational, contextual, interperitive, etc. etc. This is doubly true when considering art and artists; _[Sprechstimme's](https://www.britannica.com/art/Sprechstimme)_ significant and [continuing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dNLAhL46xM) [impact](https://jenniferwalshe.bandcamp.com/album/all-the-many-peopls) in classical vocal music is a perfect example of this enormous grey area.

- I know it's a psychoactive drug, but I simply cannot imagine extending my sobriety to caffine.
