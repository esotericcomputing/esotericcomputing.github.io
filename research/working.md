## On Hierarchy

I'm working to better understand the context in which Ranganathan (hereafter, R.) was raised, because I find it fascinating that Colon Classification -- a pure faceted system -- arose from someone living in a deeply hierarchical social milleiu. One might expect someone coming from this background to design a knowledge-structuring system of reinforcing rather than dissipating hierarchical elements. 

Trautmann (2011) provides some helpful clarification for Westerners: What we typically think of as "caste" is more properly "_varna_." The Vedic tradition (the classical system of Hindu knowledge and philosophy) divides people into four _varnas_, which specify an individual's _dharma_ (Reductively: One's duty in life). The _Rig Veda_ (c. 1500-1000 bce) includes a creation story in which "the primordial being, Purusha (man or spirit), often also called Prajapti, lord of creatures, or Brahma" completes a complex act of self-sacrifice, in which 

> ...parts of his dismembered body became the things of the phenomenal universe (animals, plants, the division of time, and so forth) including human society in its four parts: From his mouth can the _brahmin_, who is associated with the sacred utterance of the Veda; from his arms, the _kshatriya_ or warrior; from his thighs, the _vaishya_ farmer and tradesman; and from his feet the _shudra_ or servant. (96)

Parallel to this esoteric system, we have the boots-on-the-ground system of _jatis_ which are more akin to clans in the Western context: Extended family groups typically associated with a particular region and occupation, with complex social norms governing inter-jati marriages and economic relations. And finally, we have the castes proper, which "number in the thousands and they are generally limited in their extent to a single region of India." Caste provided yet another layer of social and economic norms, which often entrapped lower-caste individuals in disadvantageous circumstances. While discrimination based on caste was officially outlawed with "[the constitutions adopted by India in 1949 and by Pakistan in 1953](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dalit)", it still remains a relevant social grouping. Reparative legal frameworks (similar to Affirmative Action in the U.S.) exist for "scheduled castes;" And in India's democracy, castes often function as political interest groups whose influence politicians and governments must be cognizant of.

But, of course, this is only the internal layer of the hierarchy: There is also the British Raj (1858-1947) to contend with.<sup>1</sup> R. was born in 1892, in present-day [Sirkazhi / Siyali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkazhi), [Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanjavur,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@10.0078203,77.8920773,7.04z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3baab89cea453039:0xe113da9b1f632be6!8m2!3d10.7869994!4d79.1378274!16zL20vMDFfemtt?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), then located in the British Raj's [Madras Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency). Butterworth (1932) notes, "The storm of the \[1958\] mutiny raised only a couple of ripples in Madras. ...The transfer of the government of India to the crown caused no stir whatever. The local annals are silent on the subject because methods and principles remained unchanged." (267) However, Madras was hit particularly hard by the 1876-7 famine, including about a third of the fallowed land and some four million deaths.<sup>2</sup>




## Acharya

I've been popping through a collection of essays by the Indian Anarchist M.P.T. Acharya on my BART commutes to-and-from work (_oh, the irony!_). Acharya and R. overlap in some surface respects: They were born just a few years apart to _brahmin_ families in the Madras states; but beyond this, I'm as yet unaware if their divergent trajectories ever crossed.

Acharya's family was influential in the opening phases of the formal Indian Nationalist movement, and he took to the written word early. His predilection for political envelop-pushing eventually necessitated a flight to continental Europe, where he linked up with various threads of the international communist and anarchist movements; His increasingly radical writings were banned in his home country by the British Raj from 1910 to 1935. The collection I'm reading (ed. Laursen, 2019) spans 1923 to 1953, and the essays therein are perhaps better termed missives; They're typically only a few hundred words long, and respond to current events.

Beyond opposition to hierarchical organizations, anarchists are a pretty heterogeneous bunch when it comes to theory & praxis. From the pieces I've read so far, his work is utopian rather than practical: He advocates for the abolition of money, government beyond commune-level direct democracy, the military, etc. etc. In the context of the nationalist movement, Acharya's pacifism resulted in an interesting relationship with his contemporary Mahatma Gandhi (better-known both contemporarily and historically). Sometimes effusive in praise (_Gandhi and Non-Violence_, 1930; _Nationalism in India_, 1933), Acharya also criticized Gandhi's approach to pacifism for concluding at civil disobedience rather than disavowing the violent coercion present at the root of the State.<sup>3</sup> (_Mother India_, 1928)

To put a slightly finer point on this, Acharya saw the cessation of British rule as an opportunity for social liberation; Rather than replacing one government with another, he instead _advocated against the formation of a constitution_, and devolving sovereignty directly to the people.

Being still new to anarchist theory, there is a steady, illicit thrill in encountering ideas like this: Constitutions, Bills of rights, and other government-formation documents are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they draw boundaries around what the State can and cannot do; But on the other, their existence legitimizes both State control of the citizenry, _and_ a framework for expanding the circumstances and nature of this control. If a country without a constitution seems a bit too wacky, a bit too utopian, even a cursory glance through the history books will reveal it's a rare day indeed when legislation dissipates rather than consolidates State power -- so in another way of thinking, it's actually deeply practical to decline repeating this pattern.






## Notes

1. The East India Company's control of India (the "Company Raj") lasted from the mid-1700s until the rebellion of 1858, after which the EIC was disolved and India was govered directly by Queen Victoria (later titled "Empress of India" by Parliament in 1876). Both modern-day Pakistan and Myanmar (then Burma) were included in British India; The 1949 partition at the conclusion of British rule is its own terrible saga. Â¶ British partisan Moorehouse (1983) notes the 1958 rebellion arose in a decentralized manner, with different instigating events for different demographics, and opines that "what the whole episode never remotely resembled was a national struggle for independence as some Indians in the 20<sup>th</sup> century wish to believe." One might question what other motivation the opressed might have for slaughtering their opressors? In any event, attrocities were perpetrated on both sides of the firing line.

2. Prior to the famine, Madras was experiencing an annual population growth of about 1.2 million; Afterword, its population growth remained halted until 1881. (Butterworth, 1932)

3. E.g. The legislatively-sanctioned ability of the police and military to enact violence on citizens; See ([Wacks, 2014](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophy-of-law-a-very-short-introduction-9780199687008)) and (Graeber, 2015). 




## Leaves / Pressings

"Katarzyna Niewiadoma, looking resplendent in yellow"

SFPL used to have a page where they talked about not complying with some parts of the Patriot Act that involved FBI requests for patron records. This was way back in the early 2000s and it's not there any more.

Serious Person / Unserious Persion is a false dichotomy: A perons's seriousness is temporal, relational, contextual, interperitive, etc. etc. This is doubly true when considering art and artists; _[Sprechstimme's](https://www.britannica.com/art/Sprechstimme)_ significant and [continuing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dNLAhL46xM) [impact](https://jenniferwalshe.bandcamp.com/album/all-the-many-peopls) in classical vocal music is a perfect example of this enormous grey area.
