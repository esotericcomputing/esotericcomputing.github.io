"[libraries] in 'establishment institutions liek the church, government, and the professions, where libraries and their staff have for the most part occupied a relatively low status in the hierarchy of power." (Black, p. 4)

"On the other hand, it is probably fair to say that, while contributing to, and feeding off, the development and diversification of modern history, library historians could have done more over the decades to integrate their field with other fields of historical study. In being less attentive than they might have been to ‘mainstream’ history, library historians have laid themselves open to the accusation – albeit an unfair one – that their field has not moved far enough away from its antiquarian past. As well as borrowing too little from the rich endeavours of ‘other’ history, library historians have also been sparing in their employment of theory drawn from other disciplines, whether from sociology or cultural studies, philosophy or architecture. There are, of course, many exceptions to this general observation – indeed, this volume is densely populated with them. It is also the case that the search for facts and evidence in library history remains crucial and should not be abandoned in any mad ‘rush for theory’. However, it has to be said that the better library history is often that which is infused and illuminated in some way by knowledge and contexts extracted from outside the primary and secondary sources of the subject. Such discursive studies are characterised by a willingness of library historians to admit that they need something on which to hang their work. ¶ During the course of its recent development a tension has emerged in library history between description and analysis, between fact-grubbing and theory. However, the tension is much less pronounced in some areas of library history than in others. In considering the relationship between fact and theory in library history, it is possible to construct a taxonomy of institutions that warrant varying mixes of factual and theoretical approaches. Theory-rich approaches have been relatively common in public library history and in the history of the profession of librarianship. Here, although there is always more to be discovered, the facts of past development are fairly well known and widely available in secondary sources. Hence, the emphasis is now more on the development of theoretical interpretations rather than on disclosure of fresh primary sources. Topics where the need for factual discovery and for theory are more or less equally weighted include libraries in higher education, middle- class subscription libraries and specialist libraries of various kinds. Finally, situated at the far end of the spectrum are libraries that we might include in a category labelled ‘hidden’: libraries of a marginal and often ephemeral nature.14 Here, the general priority has been – and will continue to be – the gathering of raw evidence, although exciting theoretical perspectives and opportunities inevitably present themselves and should be encouraged." (Black, p. 5)


... "The study of minutiae in library history provides ammunition for fresh the- oretical perspectives revealing the meaning of common, microscopic social practices and beliefs leading to the decoding of the discourses and practices of librarians, readers, benefactors or promoters. Attempts might thus be made to obtain the meaning of opening ceremonies; or of architectural styles; or of the ‘haven’ or ‘rural’ and other metaphors employed in respect of libraries; or of the change in emphasis in public library hygiene in the late-Victorian age away from ensuring clean air and good ventilation, towards fears concern- ing the lending and circulation of supposedly disease-ridden books, thereby reflecting the medico-moral discourse concerning the source of disease – said to be foul air in the mid-nineteenth century, but Pasteur’s germs by the late nineteenthcentury.Whetheronespokeinalibrary,returnedbookslatedelib- erately or queued quiescently for long periods at the closed-access counter or the open-access wicket gate can reveal much, for example, about issues of discipline and rebellion in both the library and wider social setting."

Hewitt "Extending the public library 1850-1930"

"much of the early literature on library outreach is exhortation rather than description, and the coverage of outreach in existing library histories is rather sketchy." (72)

"the process of achieving necessary sup- port for the adoption of the Library Acts almost invariably involved a con- siderable campaign of publicity, and it was tempting for promoters to feel that the library was already, at its foundation, enshrined in the communal consciousness." (72)

"the era of closed stacks"

re Manchester: "In the 1870s and 1880s regular weekly lists of new accessions were published in local newspapers"

Significant emphesis on local libraries



Around 1890 there are signs of a shift in temper, heralded by Peter Cowell’s essay, ‘How to popularize the library’, published in the New Review in October 1893. Cowell advocated a range of activities which neatly encompassed the elements of outreach that dominated the ensuing twenty years: lectures (and library lecture halls), contacts with local associations (and the provision of meeting space for them), specialised catalogues and handlists, distribution of leaflets and circulars, attention to favourable press coverage and (albeit obliquely) library exhibitions. (73)

"Library lectures spread rapidly and by the early 1900s had become a staple of outreach activity" (74)





and lists of new acquisitions 




### TK DEVIN BELOW


In the late 19th c., because of their localized funding structures, library outreach (then termed "expansion") was sometimes limited by the library's capacity to provide services. (A closed-stacks model was common until around TK TK ). But as public libraries became more established through the 1890s, promotional efforts previously limited to announcements of new stock acquisition in the press expanded, most notably in the area of lecture series, partnering with local associations, and the publication of library bulletins. The cost of printing bulletins was typically offset by advertising, and "by 1914 it appears that the bulk of library magazines were free." (Hewitt, TK vol 3.) 

After the war, bulletin-printing struggled to recover, but lectures makde a comeback by the mid-20s; The emergece of radio talks in the 1930s would lead to their eventual decline.

TK TK what is the 1919 act? Is this the one that lifted the penny rate limit?





"By the 1890s specially installed display cases, int he entrace of adjacent to the borrowing counters, seem to have been becoming common... library services often had exhibitions and displays that had little connection with the library. In other places, such as Birmingham, an organisationally distinct gallery or museum was housed within the library." (Hewitt, TK vol 3., p.76) 

Around the outset of the Great War, "The mythic transformation from the librarian-as-conservator to the librarian-as-missionary was widely celebrated." (Hewitt, TK vol 3, p.78)



"The war changed everything, and its shadow stretches right through to the end of the period under discussion here. On the one hand, frenzied attention to recovery, reconstruction and the post-war economic struggle prompted renewed interest in the potential of the library, and brought the abolition of the penny rate limit. On the other, the disruptions and legacy of the war rendered the new vistas of 1919 a delusion. Not until the later 1920s was it finally possible to discern a new sense of dynamism" (Hewitt, TK vol 3,. p.78)

"As librarians were carried along by the new fears of technological and economic backwardness, libraries were reconceptualised as mechanisms of busi- ness and industrial education, ‘arsenals in which the producers may forge their implements of knowledge’, as the Library Association Record rather unfortunately expressed it in 1918." (Hewitt, TK vol 3,. p.78)



(Inititally, the approval of Library funding was contingent on nearby or new schools providing practical classes using the library's materials.)

"However, during the Regency and a bit beyond, the patrons of the libraries paid a fee to use the materials within. Printed books from the time of the Gutenberg Bible onward were a rich man’s pleasure. Those of modest means, though they may be able to read and write, could not afford to purchase books."

It was during the 1880s and 90s, however, that a new pattern of organised private philanthropy emerged in Britain which would provide both the motivation and means for previously sluggish or impoverished local authorities to adopt the Act.
